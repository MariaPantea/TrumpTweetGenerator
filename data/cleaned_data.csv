national security adviser suggested today that sanctions amp protests have iran choked off will force them to negotiate actually i couldn t care less if they negotiate will be totally up to them but no nuclear weapons and don t kill your protesters
many believe that by the senate giving credence to a trial based on the no evidence no crime read the transcripts no pressure impeachment hoax rather than an outright dismissal it gives the partisan democrat witch hunt credibility that it otherwise does not have i agree !
wow ! crazy bernie sanders is surging in the polls looking very good against his opponents in the do nothing party so what does this all mean \? stay tuned !

why should i have the stigma of impeachment attached to my name when i did nothing wrong read the transcripts ! hose republicans voted plus we got three dems very unfair to tens of millions of voters !
why did nervous nancy allow corrupt politician shifty schiff to lie before congress \? he must be a witness and so should she !
and then helped to fund them and zero progress was made on curbing those activities until trump droned soleimani plainly trump is not a warmonger he s a deal maker amp his record is that of someone who uses our military might as a deterrent unleashes it with
discretion and only as a last resort thank you to the great michael goodwin could not have said it better myself !
michael goodwin new york post trump s peace through strength philosophy is what america needs his \( john kerry \) claim bears no relation to reality the agreement didn t create opportunities for america amp other signatories to confront iran s malign activities it overlooked
to the leaders of iran do not kill your protesters thousands have already been killed or imprisoned by you and the world is watching more importantly the usa is watching turn your internet back on and let reporters roam free ! stop the killing of your great iranian people !
congratulations to the great state of tennessee you ve got yourselves a fantastic football team big win last night !
the government of iran must allow human rights groups to monitor and report facts from the ground on the ongoing protests by the iranian people there can not be another massacre of peaceful protesters nor an internet shutdown the world is watching
to the brave long suffering people of iran i 've stood with you since the beginning of my presidency and my administration will continue to stand with you we are following your protests closely and are inspired by your courage
approval rating in the republican party a record approval rating overall \( can we add to percent because of the trump thing \? \) thank you !
nancy pelosi will go down as the absolute worst speaker of the house in u s history !
new polling shows that the totally partisan impeachment hoax is going nowhere a vast majority want the do nothing democrats to move on to other things now !
where have the radical left do nothing democrats gone when they have spent the last days defending the life of qassem soleimani one of the worst terrorists in history and the father of the roadside bomb \? he was also looking to do big future damage ! dems are unhinged
heading to toledo ohio for first rally of the year tremendous crowd here we go for a big win !

breaking news the fifth circuit court of appeals just reversed a lower court decision amp gave us the go ahead to build one of the largest sections of the desperately needed southern border wall four billion dollars entire wall is under construction or getting ready to start !
hope that all house republicans will vote against crazy nancy pelosi s war powers resolution also remember her speed amp rush in getting the impeachment hoax voted on amp done well she never sent the articles to the senate just another democrat fraud presidential harassment !
pelosi doesn t want to hand over the articles of impeachment which were fraudulently produced by corrupt politicians like shifty schiff in the first place because after all of these years of investigations and persecution they show no crimes and are a joke and a scam !
all is well ! missiles launched from iran at two military bases located in iraq assessment of casualties amp damages taking place now so far so good ! we have the most powerful and well equipped military anywhere in the world by far ! i will be making a statement tomorrow morning
if however the city or state in question is willing to acknowledge responsibility and politely asks for help from the federal government we will very seriously consider getting involved in order to make those poorly run democrat cities great again !
the homeless situation in los angeles san francisco and many other democrat party run cities throughout the nation is a state and local problem not a federal problem
congress amp the president should not be wasting their time and energy on a continuation of the totally partisan impeachment hoax when we have so many important matters pending to zero was the republican house vote amp we got dems this was not what the founders had in mind !
the impeachment hoax just a continuation of the witch hunt which started even before i won the election must end quickly read the transcripts see the ukrainian president s strong statement no pressure get this done it is a con game by the dems to help with the election !
these media posts will serve as notification to the united states congress that should iran strike any u s person or target the united states will quickly amp fully strike back amp perhaps in a disproportionate manner such legal notice is not required but is given nevertheless !
the united states just spent two trillion dollars on military equipment we are the biggest and by far the best in the world ! if iran attacks an american base or any american we will be sending some of that brand new beautiful equipment their way and without hesitation !
hundreds of iranian protesters he was already attacking our embassy and preparing for additional hits in other locations iran has been nothing but problems for many years let this serve as a warning that if iran strikes any americans or american assets we have
targeted iranian sites \( representing the american hostages taken by iran many years ago \) some at a very high level amp important to iran amp the iranian culture and those targets and iran itself will be hit very fast and very hard the usa wants no more threats !
iran is talking very boldly about targeting certain usa assets as revenge for our ridding the world of their terrorist leader who had just killed an american amp badly wounded many others not to mention all of the people he had killed over his lifetime including recently
as hard as i work amp as successful as our country has become with our economy our military amp everything else it is ashame that the democrats make us spend so much time amp money on this ridiculous impeachment lite hoax i should be able to devote all of my time to the real usa !
approval rating in the republican party thank you !
different places that he thought were wasteful and the career staff as they always do pushed back and made a million excuses as to why they could not possibly stop spending u s taxpayer money there was a back amp forth over the legal arguments amp the w h decision was
followed and then it was withdrawn the democrats argument for impeachment has not gotten stronger over the last few weeks as senator josh hawley just said he s going to enter a motion to dismiss the impeachment trial because it s never actually been brought to trial
christopher bedford the federalist senior editor there is nothing new in these emails at all that s been discovered it s exactly what we knew before which is that the white house amp political figures wanted to cut off aid trump wanted to question aid to a number of

and more control over iraq and the people of iraq are not happy with that it will never end well !
the united states has paid iraq billions of dollars a year for many years that is on top of all else we have done for them the people of iraq don t want to be dominated amp controlled by iran but ultimately that is their choice over the last years iran has gained more
general qassem soleimani has killed or badly wounded thousands of americans over an extended period of time and was plotting to kill many more but got caught ! he was directly and indirectly responsible for the death of millions of people including the recent large number
of protesters killed in iran itself while iran will never be able to properly admit it soleimani was both hated and feared within the country they are not nearly as saddened as the leaders will let the outside world believe he should have been taken out many years ago !
iran never won a war but never lost a negotiation !
had happened to a presidential candidate or president who was a democrat everybody involved would long ago be in jail for treason \( and more \) and it would be considered the crime of the century far bigger and more sinister than watergate !
a lot of very good people were taken down by a small group of dirty \( filthy \) cops politicians government officials and an investigation that was illegally started amp that spied on my campaign the witch hunt is sputtering badly but still going on \( ukraine hoax ! \) if this
sohrab ahmari new york post the trump campaign raised million in the two days following the impeachment \( scam \) vote it seems the democrats have shot themselves in the foot in one more way they set up a process they know is not going to lead to the presidents removal amp
the fake news said i played golf today and i did not ! i had meeting in various locations while closely monitoring the u s embassy situation in iraq which i am still doing the corrupt lamestream media knew this but not surprisingly failed to report or correct !
the anti benghazi !
iran will be held fully responsible for lives lost or damage incurred at any of our facilities they will pay a very big price ! this is not a warning it is a threat happy new year !
the u s embassy in iraq is amp has been for hours safe ! many of our great warfighters together with the most lethal military equipment in the world was immediately rushed to the site thank you to the president amp prime minister of iraq for their rapid response upon request
it s my opinion as a lawyer that the articles of impeachment are defective on their face which means i would like to see a motion to dismiss and have this disbursed without the necessity of a trial i don t think there should be a trial i think it should be dismissed
remember when pelosi was screaming that president trump is a danger to our nation and we must move quickly they didn t get one republican house vote and lost dems they produced no case so now she doesn t want to go to the senate she s all lies most overrated person i know !
read the transcripts !

armed congregants quickly stopped a crazed church shooter in texas if it were not for the fact that there were people inside of the church that were both armed and highly proficient in using their weapon the end result would have been catastrophic a big thank you to them !
iran killed an american contractor wounding many we strongly responded and always will now iran is orchestrating an attack on the u s embassy in iraq they will be held fully responsible in addition we expect iraq to use its forces to protect the embassy and so notified !
the democrats will do anything to avoid a trial in the senate in order to protect sleepy joe biden and expose the millions and millions of dollars that where s hunter amp possibly joe were paid by companies and countries for doing nothing joe wants no part of this mess !
our prayers are with the families of the victims and the congregation of yesterday s church attack it was over in seconds thanks to the brave parishioners who acted to protect fellow worshippers lives were saved by these heroes and texas laws allowing them to carry arms !

nancy pelosi s district in california has rapidly become one of the worst anywhere in the u s when it come to the homeless amp crime it has gotten so bad so fast she has lost total control and along with her equally incompetent governor gavin newsom it is a very sad sight !
brad blakeman i happen to believe as a lawyer that the charges are defective they don t meet the constitutional standard of high crimes and misdemeanors so i would like to see a motion to dismiss at least republican senators would agree with that there should be no trial
the radical left do nothing democrats said they wanted to rush everything through to the senate because president trump is a threat to national security \( they are vicious will say anything ! \) but now they don t want to go fast anymore they want to go very slowly liars !

this is political malpractice this is a horrible judgement call on the part of the speaker you put your members in trump friendly districts in a very difficult spot it s only going to extend it out further this looks like the joke that it actually is ben domenech
the reason the democrats don t want to submit the articles of impeachment to the senate is that they don t want corrupt politician adam shifty schiff to testify under oath nor do they want the whistleblower the missing second whistleblower the informer the bidens to testify !
the house democrats were unable to get even a single vote from the republicans on their impeachment hoax the republicans have never been so united ! the dem s case is so bad that they don t even want to go to trial !
so after the democrats gave me no due process in the house no lawyers no witnesses no nothing they now want to tell the senate how to run their trial actually they have zero proof of anything they will never even show up they want out i want an immediate trial !
the great usmca trade deal \( mexico amp canada \) has been sitting on nancy pelosi s desk for months she doesn t even know what it says amp today after passing by a wide margin in the house pelosi tried to take credit for it labor will vote for trump trade deal is great for usa !
pelosi feels her phony impeachment hoax is so pathetic she is afraid to present it to the senate which can set a date and put this whole scam into default if they refuse to show up ! the do nothings are so bad for our country !

in the end here nothing happened we don t approach anything like the egregious conduct that should be necessary before a president should be removed from office i believe that a president can t be removed from office if there is no reasonable possibility that the senate
the evidence has to be overwhelming and it is not it s not even close ken starr former independent counsel
said i m going to clean up washington i m going to help people he gave big tax cuts he s made our military strong they re mad at him because he actually did what he said he was going to do history will record we re experiencing some of the best times we ve ever
had while the democrats are just looking out for elections this president should just continue to fight like he s always fought for himself amp for this country continue to put forth policies like prescription drugs amp trade policies that s what makes this president stand
it s sad here s a gentleman who came to the white house and all they had was never to let him have an easy breath all they wanted to do is impeach him they started the day after he was elected even the day after he was sworn in but this president came to washington and

they want to impeach me \( i m not worried ! \) and yet they were all breaking the law in so many ways how can they do that and yet impeach a very successful \( economy plus \) president of the united states who has done nothing wrong \? these people are crazy !
good marks and reviews on the letter i sent to pelosi today she is the worst ! no wonder with people like her and cryin chuck schumer d c has been such a mess for so long and that includes the previous administration who \( and now we know for sure \) spied on my campaign
democrat leadership despite their denials are putting tremendous pressure on their members to vote yes on this ridiculous impeachment if they vote yes it will be much easier for republicans to win in !
senator dan sullivan is doing a great job for the people of alaska while supporting our maga agenda he fights hard everyday to support our veterans and the military dan is strong on the a and is pro jobs i give dan sullivan my complete and total endorsement !

to me and there are many options including doing them directly amp avoiding the nasty politics of this very biased commission i will make a decision at an appropriate time but in the meantime the commission on presidential debates is not authorized to speak for me \( or r s \) !
the problem is that the so called commission on presidential debates is stacked with trump haters amp never trumpers years ago they were forced to publicly apologize for modulating my microphone in the first debate against crooked hillary as president the debates are up
i look very much forward to debating whoever the lucky person is who stumbles across the finish line in the little watched do nothing democrat debates my record is so good on the economy and all else including debating that perhaps i would consider more than debates
read the transcripts ! the impeachment hoax is the greatest con job in the history of american politics ! the fake news media and their partner the democrat party are working overtime to make life for the united republican party and all it stands for as difficult as possible !

no pressure put on him to investigate sleepy joe biden even though as president i have an obligation to look into corruption and biden s actions on tape about firing the prosecutor and his son s taking millions of dollars with no knowledge or talent from a
ukrainian energy company and more millions taken from china and now reports of other companies and countries also giving him big money are certainly looking very corrupt \( to put it mildly ! \) to me both bidens should be forced to testify in this no due process scam !
why is such a focus put on nd and rd hand witnesses many of whom are never trumpers or whose lawyers are never trumpers when all you have to do is read the phone call \( transcript \) with the ukrainian president and see first hand \? he and others also stated that there was
the president has until september th to give this aid to ukraine he gets it out on september th weeks before the deadline so we give our ally aid and joe biden is not investigated remember that they get the aid and we get nothing in return the democrats
in order to continue being the most transparent president in history i will be releasing sometime this week the transcript of the first and therefore most important phone call i had with the president of ukraine i am sure you will find it tantalizing !
just like schiff fabricated my phone call he will fabricate the transcripts that he is making and releasing !

shifty adam schiff will only release doctored transcripts we haven t even seen the documents and are restricted from \( get this \) having a lawyer republicans should put out their own transcripts ! schiff must testify as to why he made up a statement from me and read it to all !
the lawyer for the whistleblower takes away all credibility from this big impeachment scam ! it should be ended and the whistleblower his lawyer and corrupt politician schiff should be investigared for fraud !

the degenerate washington post made up the story about me asking bill barr to hold a news conference never happened and there were no sources !
bill barr did not decline my request to talk about ukraine the story was a fake washington post con job with an anonymous source that doesn t exist just read the transcript the justice department already ruled that the call was good we don t have freedom of the press !

the story in the amazon washington post of course picked up by fake news cnn saying president trump asked for ag barr to host a news conference clearing him on ukraine is totally untrue and just another fake news story with anonymous sources that don t exist
years ago when media was legitimate people known as fact checkers would always call to check and see if a story was accurate nowadays they don t use fact checkers anymore they just write whatever they want !

the kurds and turkey have been fighting for many years turkey considers the pkk the worst terrorists of all others may want to come in and fight for one side or the other let them ! we are monitoring the situation closely endless wars !
very smart not to be involved in the intense fighting along the turkish border for a change those that mistakenly got us into the middle east wars are still pushing to fight they have no idea what a bad decision they have made why are they not asking for a declaration of war \?
the same people that got us into the middle east quicksand trillion dollars and many thousands of lives \( and millions of lives when you count the other side \) are now fighting to keep us there don t listen to people that haven t got a clue they have proven to be inept !
the endless wars must end !

i will be in louisiana tonight \( love it ! \) to get republicans to vote for either of our two great republican candidates and force a run off with john bel edwards who has done a really poor job of tax cutting car insurance cost \( worst in usa \) amp is suspect on your nd amendment !

we have one of three choices send in thousands of troops and win militarily hit turkey very hard financially and with sanctions or mediate a deal between turkey and the kurds !
big day of negotiations with china they want to make a deal but do i \? i meet with the vice premier tomorrow at the white house
why isn t the ig investigating his so called whistleblower \? all bad info !

the area and start a new war all over again turkey is a member of nato others say stay out let the kurds fight their own battles \( even with our financial help \) i say hit turkey very hard financially amp with sanctions if they don t play by the rules ! i am watching closely
turkey has been planning to attack the kurds for a long time they have been fighting forever we have no soldiers or military anywhere near the attack area i am trying to end the endless wars talking to both sides some want us to send tens of thousands of soldiers to
in case the kurds or turkey lose control the united states has already taken the isis militants tied to beheadings in syria known as the beetles out of that country and into a secure location controlled by the u s they are the worst of the worst !
so pathetic to see sleepy joe biden who with his son hunter and to the detriment of the american taxpayer has ripped off at least two countries for millions of dollars calling for my impeachment and i did nothing wrong joe s failing campaign gave him no other choice !
only percent want the president impeached which is pretty low considering the volume of fake news coverage but pretty high considering the fact that i did nothing wrong it is all just a continuation of the greatest scam and witch hunt in the history of our country !
so why is someone a good or great president if they needed to spy on someone else s campaign in order to win \( that didn t work out so well \) and if they were unable to fill important federal judgeships \( a record by far \) handing them all to me to choose will have soon !
daca stand with all of its negative legal implications the republicans and democrats will have a deal to let them stay in our country in very short order it would actually benefit daca and be done the right way !
president obama said that he did not have the right to sign daca that it will never hold up in court he signed it anyway ! if the supreme court upholds daca it gives the president extraordinary powers far greater than ever thought if they do what is right and do not let
so why is someone a good or great president if they needed to spy on someone else s campaign in order to win \( that didn t work out so well \) and if they were unable to fill important federal judgeships \( a record by far \) handing them all to me to chose will have soon !
the so called whistleblower before knowing i was going to release the exact transcript stated that my call with the ukrainian president was crazy frightening and completely lacking in substance related to national security this is a very big lie read the transcript !
no pressure at all said ukraine ! very congenial a perfect call the whistleblower and others spoke before seeing the transcript now they must apologize to me and stop this ridiculous impeachment !
the do nothing democrats are con artists only looking to hurt the republican party and president their total focus is nothing more and nothing less the good news is that we will win ! ! ! !
in the history of our country ! we went to war under a false amp now disproven premise weapons of mass destruction there were none ! now we are slowly amp carefully bringing our great soldiers amp military home our focus is on the big picture ! the usa is greater than ever before !
the united states has spent eight trillion dollars fighting and policing in the middle east thousands of our great soldiers have died or been badly wounded millions of people have died on the other side going into the middle east is the worst decision ever made
the whistleblower s facts have been so incorrect about my no pressure conversation with the ukrainian president and now the conflict of interest and involvement with a democrat candidate that he or she should be exposed and questioned properly this is no whistleblower
the whistleblower s lawyer is a big democrat the whistleblower has ties to one of my democrat opponents why does the icig allow this scam to continue \?

understands that while we only had soldiers remaining in that section of syria and they have been removed any unforced or unnecessary fighting by turkey will be devastating to their economy and to their very fragile currency we are helping the kurds financially weapons !

i was elected on getting out of these ridiculous endless wars where our great military functions as a policing operation to the benefit of people who don t even like the usa the two most unhappy countries at this move are russia amp china because they love seeing us bogged

the united states was supposed to be in syria for days that was many years ago we stayed and got deeper and deeper into battle with no aim in sight when i arrived in washington isis was running rampant in the area we quickly defeated of the isis caliphate
this makes nervous nancy every bit as guilty as liddle adam schiff for high crimes and misdemeanors and even treason i guess that means that they along with all of those that evilly colluded with them must all be immediately impeached !
nancy pelosi knew of all of the many shifty adam schiff lies and massive frauds perpetrated upon congress and the american people in the form of a fraudulent speech knowingly delivered as a ruthless con and the illegal meetings with a highly partisan whistleblower amp lawyer

and separately got billion dollars from china despite no experience and for no apparent reason there is no way these can be legitimate transactions \? as lawyers amp others have stated as president i have an obligation to look into possible or probable corruption !
it is incredible to watch and read the fake news and how they pull out all stops to protect sleepy joe biden and his thrown out of the military son hunter who was handed a month \( plusplus \) from a ukrainian based company even though he had no experience in energy
the democrats are lucky that they don t have any mitt romney types they may be lousy politicians with really bad policies \( open borders sanctuary cities etc \) but they stick together !

mitt romney never knew how to win he is a pompous ass who has been fighting me from the beginning except when he begged me for my endorsement for his senate run \( i gave it to him \) and when he begged me to be secretary of state \( i didn t give it to him \) he is so bad for r s !
somebody please wake up mitt romney and tell him that my conversation with the ukrainian president was a congenial and very appropriate one and my statement on china pertained to corruption not politics if mitt worked this hard on obama he could have won sadly he choked !
the so called whistleblower s account of my perfect phone call is way off not even close schiff and pelosi never thought i would release the transcript of the call got them by surprise they got caught this is a fraud against the american people !
it isn t often i get angry at the dirty politics of the democrats in congress but this time i am enraged and hope this impeachment charade will backfire on reps pelosi amp schiff amp the democrats i have read thoroughly the telephone conversation between trump amp the president
of ukraine and cannot find any reason to charge the president with high crimes amp misdemeanors this is just a phony witch hunt perpetuated by democrats to get rid of trump because they cannot beat him in a fair election richard ketay

the whistleblower who had the facts wrong about the phone call reached out and more to the democrat controlled house intelligence committee schiff never told us about this !
breaking news unemployment rate at drops to a year low wow america lets impeach your president \( even though he did nothing wrong ! \)
as president i have an obligation to end corruption even if that means requesting the help of a foreign country or countries it is done all the time this has nothing to do with politics or a political campaign against the bidens this does have to do with their corruption !
the washington times ukraine envoy blows massive hole into democrat accusations republicans at hearing find no trump pressure the ukrainian president also strongly stated that no pressure was put on him case closed !
we are simultaneously fighting the fake news media and their partner the democrat party always tough to beat the press but people are beginning to see how totally corrupt they are and it makes our job a whole lot easier !
as the president of the united states i have an absolute right perhaps even a duty to investigate or have investigated corruption and that would include asking or suggesting other countries to help us out !

election interference !

adam schiff should only be so lucky to have the brains honor and strength of secretary of state mike pompeo for a lowlife like schiff who completely fabricated my words and read them to congress as though they were said by me to demean a first in class at west point is sad !
nancy pelosi just said that she is interested in lowering prescription drug prices amp working on the desperately needed usmca she is incapable of working on either it is just camouflage for trying to win an election through impeachment the do nothing democrats are stuck in mud !
all of this impeachment nonsense which is going nowhere is driving the stock market and your k s down but that is exactly what the democrats want to do they are willing to hurt the country with only the election in mind !
now the press is trying to sell the fact that i wanted a moat stuffed with alligators and snakes with an electrified fence and sharp spikes on top at our southern border i may be tough on border security but not that tough the press has gone crazy fake news !
now the press is trying to sell the fact that i wanted a moot stuffed with alligators and snakes with an electrified fence and sharp spikes on top at our southern border i may be tough on border security but not that tough the press has gone crazy fake news !

congressman adam schiff should resign for the crime of after reading a transcript of my conversation with the president of ukraine \( it was perfect \) fraudulently fabricating a statement of the president of the united states and reading it to congress as though mine ! he is sick !

people their vote their freedoms their second amendment religion military border wall and their god given rights as a citizen of the united states of america !
republicans of louisiana it is really important for you to go out and vote on october th for either eddie rispone or ralph abraham \( both great \) which will lead to a runoff against
why isn t congressman adam schiff being brought up on charges for fraudulently making up a statement and reading it to congress as if this statement which was very dishonest and bad for me was directly made by the president of the united states \? this should never be allowed !
as i predicted jay powell and the federal reserve have allowed the dollar to get so strong especially relative to all other currencies that our manufacturers are being negatively affected fed rate too high they are their own worst enemies they don t have a clue pathetic !
the whistleblower and also the person who gave all of the false information to him this is simply about a phone conversation that could not have been nicer warmer or better no pressure at all \( as confirmed by ukrainian pres \) it is just another democrat hoax !
so if the so called whistleblower has all second hand information and almost everything he has said about my perfect call with the ukrainian president is wrong \( much to the embarrassment of pelosi amp schiff \) why aren t we entitled to interview amp learn everything about
the congratulatory phone call with the ukrainian president was perfect unless you heard liddle adam schiff s fraudulently made up version of the call this is just another fake news media together with their partner the democrat party hoax !
congratulations to president xi and the chinese people on the th anniversary of the people s republic of china !
you cannot judge my stock market performance since the inauguration which was very good but only from the day after the big election win which was spectacular due to the euphoria of getting obama biden out amp getting trump pence in wenti up big between nov amp inauguration !
the fake news media wants to stay as far away as possible from the ukraine and china deals made by the bidens a corrupt media is so bad for our country ! in actuality the media may be even more corrupt than the bidens which is hard to do !
very simple ! i was looking for corruption and also why germany france and others in the european union don t do more for ukraine why is it always the usa that does so much and puts up so much money for ukraine and other countries \? by the way the bidens were corrupt !
president trump s job approval numbers have just reached the highest level since his inauguration around and you can add to that many votes from voters that don t talk about their vote once they saw the president s numbers going up they said we gotta do something so
who changed the long standing whistleblower rules just before submittal of the fake whistleblower report \? drain the swamp !

rep adam schiff illegally made up a fake amp terrible statement pretended it to be mine as the most important part of my call to the ukrainian president and read it aloud to congress and the american people it bore no relationship to what i said on the call arrest for treason \?
the fake whistleblower complaint is not holding up it is mostly about the call to the ukrainian president which in the name of transparency i immediately released to congress amp the public the whistleblower knew almost nothing its nd hand description of the call is a fraud !
the greatest witch hunt in the history of our country !
rid of donald j trump and the democrats don t care if they burn down and destroy this nation in the process i have never seen the evangelical christians more angry over any issue than this attempt to illegitimately remove this president from office overturn the
election and negate the votes of millions of evangelicals in the process they know the only impeachable offense that president trump has committed was beating hillary clinton in that s the unpardonable sin for which the democrats will never forgive him
nancy pelosi and the democrats can t put down the impeachment match they know they couldn t beat him in against hillary clinton and they re increasingly aware of the fact that they won t win against him in and impeachment is the only tool they have to get
all that s swirling around us now is impeachment we talk about it day and night it s what s on the news there is nothing that has turned up that is impeachable our founding fathers set impeachment to be extremely rare we need to get good stuff done let the people vote
these radical left do nothing democrats are doing great harm to our country they are lying amp cheating like never before in our country s history in order to destabilize the united states of america amp it s upcoming election they amp the fake news media are dangerous amp bad !
in addition i want to meet not only my accuser who presented second amp third hand information but also the person who illegally gave this information which was largely incorrect to the whistleblower was this person spying on the u s president \? big consequences !
his lies were made in perhaps the most blatant and sinister manner ever seen in the great chamber he wrote down and read terrible things then said it was from the mouth of the president of the united states i want schiff questioned at the highest level for fraud amp treason
like every american i deserve to meet my accuser especially when this accuser the so called whistleblower represented a perfect conversation with a foreign leader in a totally inaccurate and fraudulent way then schiff made up what i actually said by lying to congress
the only people that don t like my conversation with the new ukrainian president are those that heard rep adam schiff read a made up and totally fraudulent statement to the house and public words that i did not say but that he fabricated \( amp admitted to this fabrication \) sick !
it is disgraceful what the do nothing democrats are doing \( the impeachment scam \) but it is also disgraceful what they are not doing namely the usmca vote prescription drug price reduction gun safety infrastructure and much more !
fraudulently and illegally inserted his made up amp twisted words into my call with the ukrainian president to make it look like i did something very wrong he then boldly read those words to congress and millions of people defaming amp libeling me he must resign from congress !
the whistleblower s complaint is completely different and at odds from my actual conversation with the new president of ukraine the so called whistleblower knew practically nothing in that those ridiculous charges were far more dramatic amp wrong just like liddle adam schiff
how do you impeach a president who has created the greatest economy in the history of our country entirely rebuilt our military into the most powerful it has ever been cut record taxes amp regulations fixed the va amp gotten choice for our vets \( after years \) amp so much more \?
the conversation with the new and very good ukraine president who told the fake news at the united nations that he was not pressured by me in any way shape or form should by and of itself bring an end to the new and most recent witch hunt others ended in ashes !
can you imagine if these do nothing democrat savages people like nadler schiff aoc plus and many more had a republican party who would have done to obama what the do nothings are doing to me oh well maybe next time !
if that perfect phone call with the president of ukraine isn t considered appropriate then no future president can ever again speak to another foreign leader !
sounding more and more like the so called whistleblower isn t a whistleblower at all in addition all second hand information that proved to be so inaccurate that there may not have even been somebody else a leaker or spy feeding it to him or her \? a partisan operative \?
the democrats are now to be known as the do nothing party !
rep adam schiff totally made up my conversation with ukraine president and read it to congress and millions he must resign and be investigated he has been doing this for two years he is a sick man !

rep adam schiff fraudulently read to congress with millions of people watching a version of my conversation with the president of ukraine that doesn t exist he was supposedly reading the exact transcribed version of the call but he completely changed the words to make it
sound horrible and me sound guilty he was desperate and he got caught adam schiff therefore lied to congress and attempted to defraud the american public he has been doing this for two years i am calling for him to immediately resign from congress based on this fraud !

obama loving \( wrote obama book \) peter baker of the failing new york times married to an even bigger trump hater than himself should not even be allowed to write about me every story is a made up disaster with sources and leakers that don t even exist i had a simple and very
the president of ukraine said that he was not pressured by me to do anything wrong can t have better testimony than that ! as v p biden had his son on the other hand take out millions of dollars by strong arming the ukrainian president also looted millions from china bad !
liddle adam schiff who has worked unsuccessfully for years to hurt the republican party and president has just said that the whistleblower even though he or she only had second hand information is credible how can that be with zero info and a known bias democrat scam !
adam schiff has zero credibility another fantasy to hurt the republican party !
a whistleblower with second hand information \? another fake news story ! see what was said on the very nice no pressure call another witch hunt !
is their a case for impeachment \? absolutely not ! there is no high crimes or misdemeanors no treason no extortion no treason rd robert ray respected
the democrats are trying to destroy the republican party and all that it stands for stick together play their game and fight hard republicans our country is at stake !
the greatest scam in the history of american politics !
taken out of ukraine and china additionally i demand transparency from democrats that went to ukraine and attempted to force the new president to do things that they wanted under the form of political threat
he \( president trump \) didn t specifically mention the explicit quid pro quo of unless you investigate this we re going to withhold military aid to you pamela brown
will the democrats apologize after seeing what was said on the call with the ukrainian president \? they should a perfect call got them by surprise !
there has been no president in the history of our country who has been treated so badly as i have the democrats are frozen with hatred and fear they get nothing done this should never be allowed to happen to another president witch hunt !
great new book by the brilliant andrew mccarthy ball of collusion the plot to rig an election and destroy a presidency get it and some other great new books which i will soon be recommending they tell you about the crooked pols and the witch hunt that has now been exposed !
secretary of state pompeo recieved permission from ukraine government to release the transcript of the telephone call i had with their president they don t know either what the big deal is a total witch hunt scam by the democrats !
they never even saw the transcript of the call a total witch hunt !
pelosi nadler schiff and of course maxine waters ! can you believe this \?
such an important day at the united nations so much work and so much success and the democrats purposely had to ruin and demean it with more breaking news witch hunt garbage so bad for our country !
the democrats are so focused on hurting the republican party and the president that they are unable to get anything done because of it including legislation on gun safety lowering of prescription drug prices infrastructure etc so bad for our country !
you will see it was a very friendly and totally appropriate call no pressure and unlike joe biden and his son no quid pro quo ! this is nothing more than a continuation of the greatest and most destructive witch hunt of all time !
i am currently at the united nations representing our country but have authorized the release tomorrow of the complete fully declassified and unredacted transcript of my phone conversation with president zelensky of ukraine
approval rating in the republican party thank you !
know the correct facts is he on our country s side where does he come from is this all about schiff amp the democrats again after years of being wrong \?
just leaving the great state of ohio for new york and a few big days at the united nations your country will be well represented !
breaking news the ukrainian government just said they weren t pressured at all during the nice call sleepy joe biden on the other hand forced a tough prosecutor out from investigating his son s company by threat of not giving big dollars to ukraine that s the real story !
now the fake news media says i pressured the ukrainian president at least times during my telephone call with him this supposedly comes from a so called whistleblower who they say doesn t even have a first hand account of what was said more democrat crooked media con
justice kavanaugh should sue the failing new york times for all they are worth !
go across the world and you ll see either very low interest rates or negative rates the president wants to be competitive with these other countries on this but i don t think he ll fire jay powell \( even if i should ! \) we should always be paying less interest than others !
the real story involves hunter biden going around the world and collecting large payments from foreign governments and foreign oligarchs peter schweizer laura ingraham hunter made a fortune in ukraine and in china he knew nothing about energy or anything else
the fake news media nowadays not only doesn t check for the accuracy of the facts they knowingly make up the facts they even make up sources in order to protect their partners the democrats it is so wrong but they don t even care anymore they have gone totally crazy ! ! ! !
the lamestream media had a very bad week they pushed numerous phony stories and got caught especially the failing new york times which has lost more money over the last years than any paper in history and the amazon washington post they are the enemy of the people !
it appears that an american spy in one of our intelligence agencies may have been spying on our own president the complaint suggests that this intel agent was listening in on trump s conversation
some of the best economic numbers our country has ever experienced are happening right now this is despite a crooked and demented deep state and a probably illegal democrat fake news media partnership the likes of which the world has never seen make america great again !
now that the democrats and the fake news media have gone bust on every other of their witch hunt schemes they are trying to start one just as ridiculous as the others call it the ukraine witch hunt while at the same time trying to protect sleepy joe biden will fail again !
story about me and a perfectly fine and routine conversation i had with the new president of the ukraine nothing was said that was in any way wrong but biden s demand on the other hand was a complete and total disaster the fake news knows this but doesn t want to report !
the fake news media and their partner the democrat party want to stay as far away as possible from the joe biden demand that the ukrainian government fire a prosecutor who was investigating his son or they won t get a very large amount of u s money so they fabricate a
statement strange that with so many other people hearing or knowing of the perfectly fine and respectful conversation that they would not have also come forward do you know the reason why they did not \? because there was nothing said wrong it was pitch perfect !
the radical left democrats and their fake news media partners headed up again by little adam schiff and batting zero for against me are at it again ! they think i may have had a dicey conversation with a certain foreign leader based on a highly partisan whistleblowers
because of my administration drug prices are down for the first time in almost years but the american people need congress to help i like sen grassley s drug pricing bill very much and it s great to see speaker pelosi s bill today let s get it done in a bipartisan way !
another fake news story out there it never ends ! virtually anytime i speak on the phone to a foreign leader i understand that there may be many people listening from various u s agencies not to mention those from the other country itself no problem !
knowing all of this is anybody dumb enough to believe that i would say something inappropriate with a foreign leader while on such a potentially heavily populated call i would only do what is right anyway and only do good for the usa !
all polls and some brand new polls show very little support for impeachment such a waste of time especially with sooo much good that could be done including prescription drug price reduction healthcare infrastructure etc
jay powell and the federal reserve fail again no guts no sense no vision ! a terrible communicator !
far safer and much less expensive many more cars will be produced under the new and uniform standard meaning significantly more jobs jobs jobs ! automakers should seize this opportunity because without this alternative to california you will be out of business
the trump administration is revoking california s federal waiver on emissions in order to produce far less expensive cars for the consumer while at the same time making the cars substantially safer this will lead to more production because of this pricing and safety
advantage and also due to the fact that older highly polluting cars will be replaced by new extremely environmentally friendly cars there will be very little difference in emissions between the california standard and the new u s standard but the cars will be
i am pleased to announce that i will name robert c o brien currently serving as the very successful special presidential envoy for hostage affairs at the state department as our new national security advisor i have worked long amp hard with robert he will do a great job !

so nice that our country is now energy independent the usa is in better shape than ever before strongest military by far biggest economy \( no longer even close \) number one in energy ! maga kag !
terrence k williams you can t impeach trump for being a winner !
the new york times is now blaming an editor for the horrible mistake they made in trying to destroy or influence justice brett kavanaugh it wasn t the editor the times knew everything they are sick and desperate losing in so many ways !
the new york times is at its lowest point in its long and storied history not only is it losing a lot of money but it is a journalistic disaster being laughed at even in the most liberal of enclaves it has become a very sad joke all all over the world witch hunt hurt them
she can never recover and will never return to greatness under current management the times is dead long live the new york times !
i call for the resignation of everybody at the new york times involved in the kavanaugh smear story and while you re at it the russian witch hunt hoax which is just as phony ! they ve taken the old grey lady and broken her down destroyed her virtue and ruined her reputation
they failed on the mueller report they failed on robert mueller s testimony they failed on everything else so now the democrats are trying to build a case that i enrich myself by being president good idea except i will and have always expected to lose billions of dollars
for the privilege of being your president and doing the best job that has been done in many decades i am far beyond somebody paying for a hotel room for the evening or filling up a gas tank at an airport i do not own these radical left democrats are crazy ! obama netflix \?
remember when iran shot down a drone saying knowingly that it was in their airspace when in fact it was nowhere close they stuck strongly to that story knowing that it was a very big lie now they say that they had nothing to do with the attack on saudi arabia we ll see \?
the united states because of the federal reserve is paying a much higher interest rate than other competing countries they can t believe how lucky they are that jay powell amp the fed don t have a clue and now on top of it all the oil hit big interest rate drop stimulus !
producer prices in china shrank most in years due to china s big devaluation of their currency coupled with monetary stimulus federal reserve not watching \? will fed ever get into the game \? dollar strongest ever ! really bad for exports no inflation highest interest rates
because we have done so well with energy over the last few years \( thank you mr president ! \) we are a net energy exporter amp now the number one energy producer in the world we don t need middle eastern oil amp gas amp in fact have very few tankers there but will help our allies !
these conservative judicial appointments will impact our nation for years to come said lindsey graham republican of south carolina who leads the judiciary committee and who has been speeding through trump nominees the entire court system is changing at a record pace !
house judiciary has given up on the mueller report sadly for them after two years and spent zero collusion zero obstruction so they say ok lets look at everything else and all of the deals that trump has done over his lifetime but it doesn t
work that way i have a better idea look at the obama book deal or the ridiculous netflix deal then look at all the deals made by the dems in congress the congressional slush fund and lastly the ig reports take a look at them those investigations would be over fast !
the fake news is saying that i am willing to meet with iran no conditions that is an incorrect statement \( as usual ! \)
here we go again with general motors and the united auto workers get together and make a deal !
saudi arabia oil supply was attacked there is reason to believe that we know the culprit are locked and loaded depending on verification but are waiting to hear from the kingdom as to who they believe was the cause of this attack and under what terms we would proceed !
sufficient to keep the markets well supplied i have also informed all appropriate agencies to expedite approvals of the oil pipelines currently in the permitting process in texas and various other states
based on the attack on saudi arabia which may have an impact on oil prices i have authorized the release of oil from the strategic petroleum reserve if needed in a to be determined amount

brett kavanaugh should start suing people for liable or the justice department should come to his rescue the lies being told about him are unbelievable false accusations without recrimination when does it stop \? they are trying to influence his opinions can t let that happen !

very stupidly negotiated trade deals and illegal immigration are a tremendous cost and burden to our country they are both coming along very well and someday in the not too distant future america will see a very positive change remember america first !
illegal immigration costs the usa over billion dollars a year there is no reason for this and things are being set in motion to have this number come way down democrats could end loopholes and it would be a whole lot easier and faster but it will all happen anyway !
ig report which showed him to be a disgraced amp dirty cop republicans have unified like never before you don t impeach presidents for doing a good \( great ! \) job no obstruction no collusion only treasonous crimes committed by the other side and led by the democrats sad !

in a hypothetical poll done by one of the worst pollsters of them all the amazon washington post abc which predicted i would lose to crooked hillary by points \( how did that work out \? \) sleepy joe pocahontas and virtually all others would beat me in the general election
this is a phony suppression poll meant to build up their democrat partners i haven t even started campaigning yet and am constantly fighting fake news like russia russia russia look at north carolina last night dan bishop down big in the polls wins easier than !
the federal reserve should get our interest rates down to zero or less and we should then start to refinance our debt interest cost could be brought way down while at the same time substantially lengthening the term we have the great currency power and balance sheet
the usa should always be paying the the lowest rate no inflation ! it is only the na vet of jay powell and the federal reserve that doesn t allow us to do what other countries are already doing a once in a lifetime opportunity that we are missing because of boneheads
greg murphy won big to in north carolina amp the fake news barely covered the race the win was far bigger than anticipated there was just nothing the fakers could say to diminish or demean the scope of this victory so we had two big victories tonight greg amp dan !

vote today for dan bishop will be great for north carolina and our country !
one of the greatest and most powerful weapons used by the fake and corrupt news media is the phony polling information they put out many of these polls are fixed or worked in such a way that a certain candidate will look good or bad internal polling looks great the best ever !
abc washington post poll was the worst and most inaccurate poll of any taken prior to the election when my lawyers protested they took a point down and brought it to almost even by election day it was a fake poll by two very bad and dangerous media outlets sad !
north carolina vote for dan bishop today we need him badly in washington !

the economy where there is no recession much to the regret of the lamestream media ! they are working overtime to help the democrats win in but that will never happen americans are too smart !
the look of turmoil in the white house of which there is none i view much of the media as simply an arm of the democrat party they are corrupt and they are extremely upset at how well our country is doing under my leadership including
a lot of fake news is being reported that i overruled the vp and various advisers on a potential camp david meeting with the taliban this story is false ! i always think it is good to meet and talk but in this case i decided not to the dishonest media likes to create
the trump administration has achieved more in the first years of its existence than perhaps any administration in the history of our country we get zero media credit for what we have done and are doing but the people know and that s all that is important !
i know nothing about an air force plane landing at an airport \( which i do not own and have nothing to do with \) near turnberry resort \( which i do own \) in scotland and filling up with fuel with the crew staying overnight at turnberry \( they have good taste ! \) nothing to do with me
the trump administrations has achieved more in the first years of its existence than perhaps any administration in the history of our country we get zero media credit for what we have done and are doing but the people know and that s all that is important !
that this administration has done they don t talk about the great economy the big tax and regulation cuts the rebuilding of the military choice at our va our vets judges and supreme court justices the border wall going up lowest crime numbers nd a and so much more !

when all of the people pushing so hard for criminal justice reform were unable to come even close to getting it done they came to me as a group and asked for my help i got it done with a group of senators amp others who would never have gone for it obama couldn t come close
the importance or passage of criminal justice reform they only talk about the minor players or people that had nothing to do with it and the people that so desperately sought my help when everyone else had failed all they talk about now is impeaching president trump !
looking forward to being in the north carolina tomorrow night we re having a big rally for a great guy dan bishop strong on crime borders your military and our vets we need dan bishop in washington badly his opponent is weak on crime borders and against your nd a
an attack in kabul that killed one of our great great soldiers and other people i immediately cancelled the meeting and called off peace negotiations what kind of people would kill so many in order to seemingly strengthen their bargaining position \? they didn t they
only made it worse ! if they cannot agree to a ceasefire during these very important peace talks and would even kill innocent people then they probably don t have the power to negotiate a meaningful agreement anyway how many more decades are they willing to fight \?
unbeknownst to almost everyone the major taliban leaders and separately the president of afghanistan were going to secretly meet with me at camp david on sunday they were coming to the united states tonight unfortunately in order to build false leverage they admitted to
fake news i would like very much to stop referring to this ridiculous story but the lamestream media just won t let it alone they always have to have the last word even though they know they are defrauding amp deceiving the public the public knows that the media is corrupt !
the failing new york times stated in an article written by obama flunky peter baker \( who lovingly wrote obama book \) even after the president forecast the storm to include alabama this is not true i said very early on that it may even hit alabama a big difference

the fake news media was fixated on the fact that i properly said at the beginnings of hurricane dorian that in addition to florida amp other states alabama may also be grazed or hit they went crazy hoping against hope that i made a mistake \( which i didn t \) check out maps
this nonsense has never happened to another president four days of corrupt reporting still without an apology but there are many things that the fake news media has not apologized to me for like the witch hunt or spygate ! the lamestream media and their democrat
daca will be going before the supreme court it is a document that even president obama didn t feel he had the legal right to sign he signed it anyway ! rest assured that if the sc does what all say it must based on the law a bipartisan deal will be made to the benefit of all !
have the discretion to end the program that president obama began in his discretion that program was unlawful to begin with i think it s very unlikely that the scotus is going to issue an order reinstating what it believes is an unlawful program daca is unlawful
president obama never had the legal right to sign daca and he indicated so at the time of signing but in any event how can he have the right to sign and i don t have the right to unsigned totally illegal document which would actually give the president new powers
the immigration law institute s christopher hajec says the supreme court has to look st whether daca is lawful what they are looking at now is whether trump s recision of daca is lawful must consider lawfulness of daca itself looks very odd that president trump doesn t
i think president trump is set in his ways because he doesn t see any weakening i mean look at the joblessness report today what i m surprised at is how strong the consumer is i think the chinese need it \( a deal \) more than we do it s statistical i just think

bad actress debra the mess messing is in hot water she wants to create a blacklist of trump supporters amp is being accused of mccarthyism is also being accused of being a racist because of the terrible things she said about blacks and mental illness if roseanne barr
in the early days of the hurricane when it was predicted that dorian would go through miami or west palm beach even before it reached the bahamas certain models strongly suggested that alabama amp georgia would be hit as it made its way through florida amp to the gulf
instead it turned north and went up the coast where it continues now in the one model through florida the great state of alabama would have been hit or grazed in the path it took no read my full fema statement what i said was accurate ! all fake news in order to demean !
absolutely nothing is more important than going back amp getting to the bottom of the origins of the investigation we had an administration using america s spying apparatus to spy on a political opponent at the height of a presidential election those are all known undisputed

for many years china \( and many other countries \) has been taking advantage of the united states on trade intellectual property theft and much more our country has been losing hundreds of billions of dollars a year to china with no end in sight

the economy is strong and good whereas the rest of the world is not doing so well despite this the fake news media together with their partner the democrat party are working overtime to convince people that we are in or will soon be going into a recession they are
willing to lose their wealth or a big part of it just for the possibility of winning the election but it won t work because i always find a way to win especially for the people ! the greatest political movement in the history of our country will have another big win in !

the economy is doing really well the federal reserve can easily make it record setting ! the question is being asked why are we paying much more in interest than germany and certain other countries \? be early \( for a change \) not late let america win big rather than just win !
germany sells year bonds offering negative yields germany competes with the usa our federal reserve does not allow us to do what we must do they put us at a disadvantage against our competition strong dollar no inflation ! they move like quicksand fight or go home !
that when this administration s alternative is no longer available california will squeeze them to a point of business ruin only reason california is now talking to them is because the feds are giving a far better alternative which is much better for consumers !
henry ford would be very disappointed if he saw his modern day descendants wanting to build a much more expensive car that is far less safe and doesn t work as well because execs don t want to fight california regulators car companies should know
the legendary henry ford and alfred p sloan the founders of ford motor company and general motors are rolling over at the weakness of current car company executives willing to spend more money on a car that is not as safe or good and cost more to consumers crazy !
because of me these countries have agreed to pay one hundred billion dollars more but still way short of what they should pay for the incredible military protection provided sorry !
for the record denmark is only at of gdp for nato spending they are a wealthy country and should be at we protect europe and yet only of the nato countries are at the mark the united states is at a much much higher level than that
so germany is paying zero interest and is actually being paid to borrow money while the u s a far stronger and more important credit is paying interest and just stopped \( i hope ! \) quantitative tightening strongest dollar in history very tough on exports no inflation !
where is the federal reserve \?
my proposal to the politically correct automobile companies would lower the average price of a car to consumers by more than while at the same time making the cars substantially safer engines would run smoother very little impact on the environment ! foolish executives !
doing great with china and other trade deals the only problem we have is jay powell and the fed he s like a golfer who can t putt has no touch big u s growth if he does the right thing big cut but don t count on him ! so far he has called it wrong and only let us down
we are competing with many countries that have a far lower interest rate and we should be lower than them yesterday highest dollar in u s history no inflation wake up federal reserve such growth potential almost like never before !

our economy is very strong despite the horrendous lack of vision by jay powell and the fed but the democrats are trying to will the economy to be bad for purposes of the election very selfish ! our dollar is so strong that it is sadly hurting other parts of the world
the fed rate over a fairly short period of time should be reduced by at least basis points with perhaps some quantitative easing as well if that happened our economy would be even better and the world economy would be greatly and quickly enhanced good for everyone !

rep tlaib wrote a letter to israeli officials desperately wanting to visit her grandmother permission was quickly granted whereupon tlaib obnoxiously turned the approval down a complete setup the only real winner here is tlaib s grandmother she doesn t have to see her now !
israel was very respectful amp nice to rep rashida tlaib allowing her permission to visit her grandmother as soon as she was granted permission she grandstanded amp loudly proclaimed she would not visit israel could this possibly have been a setup \? israel acted appropriately !

if they don t get this trade deal with the u s done china could have it first recession \( or worse ! \) in years there s disinvestment in china right now also the fed is too tight \( i agree \) steve moore heritage foundation
the fake news media is doing everything they can to crash the economy because they think that will be bad for me and my re election the problem they have is that the economy is way too strong and we will soon be winning big on trade and everyone knows that including china !
representatives omar and tlaib are the face of the democrat party and they hate israel !

i know president xi of china very well he is a great leader who very much has the respect of his people he is also a good man in a tough business i have zero doubt that if president xi wants to quickly and humanely solve the hong kong problem he can do it personal meeting \?
good things were stated on the call with china the other day they are eating the tariffs with the devaluation of their currency and pouring money into their system the american consumer is fine with or without the september date but much good will come from the short
deferral to december it actually helps china more than us but will be reciprocated millions of jobs are being lost in china to other non tariffed countries thousands of companies are leaving of course china wants to make a deal let them work humanely with hong kong first !
we are winning big time against china companies amp jobs are fleeing prices to us have not gone up and in some cases have come down china is not our problem though hong kong is not helping our problem is with the fed raised too much amp too fast now too slow to cut
spread is way too much as other countries say thank you to clueless jay powell and the federal reserve germany and many others are playing the game ! crazy inverted yield curve ! we should easily be reaping big rewards amp gains but the fed is holding us back we will win !
tremendous amounts of money pouring into the united states people want safety !
no debate on election security should go forward without first agreeing that voter id \( identification \) must play a very strong part in any final agreement without voter id it is all so meaningless !

all the news that s not fit to print ! the new york times is no longer the paper we grew up with it is no longer a news organization it is now an agenda driven organization out to change the country \( for the worse ! \) michael goodwin highly respected new york post columnist
as usual china said they were going to be buying big from our great american farmers so far they have not done what they said maybe this will be different !
would chris cuomo be given a red flag for his recent rant \? filthy language and a total loss of control he shouldn t be allowed to have any weapon he s nuts !

scaramucci who like so many others had nothing to do with my election victory is only upset that i didn t want him back in the administration \( where he desperately wanted to be \) also i seldom had time to return his many calls to me he just wanted to be on tv !
many incredible things are happening right now for our country after years of being ripped off by other nations on both trade deals and the military things are changing fast big progress is being made america is respected again keep america great !
tv talent then during the election i would watch as joe scarborough amp his very angry psycho wife \( \? \) would push donny to the point of total humiliation he would never fight back because he wanted to stay on tv even on a very low rated show all in the name of ambition !
anthony scaramucci who was quickly terminated \( days \) from a position that he was totally incapable of handling now seems to do nothing but television as the all time expert on president trump like many other so called television experts he knows very little about me
other than the fact that this administration has probably done more than any other administration in its first years of existence anthony who would do anything to come back in should remember the only reason he is on tv and it s not for being the mooch !
joe biden just said we believe in facts not truth does anybody really believe he is mentally fit to be president \? we are playing in a very big and complicated world joe doesn t have a clue !

china wants to make a deal so badly thousands of companies are leaving because of the tariffs they must stem the flow at the same time china may be hoping for a democrat to win so they could continue the great ripoff of america amp the theft of hundreds of billions of s !

proud to admit their mistake of acting too fast and tightening too much \( and that i was right ! \) they must cut rates bigger and faster and stop their ridiculous quantitative tightening now yield curve is at too wide a margin and no inflation ! incompetence is a
three more central banks cut rates our problem is not china we are stronger than ever money is pouring into the u s while china is losing companies by the thousands to other countries and their currency is under siege our problem is a federal reserve that is too

china is intent on continuing to receive the hundreds of billions of dollars they have been taking from the u s with unfair trade practices and currency manipulation so one sided it should have been stopped many years ago !
based on the historic currency manipulation by china it is now even more obvious to everyone that americans are not paying for the tariffs they are being paid for compliments of china and the u s is taking in tens of billions of dollars ! china has always
used currency manipulation to steal our businesses and factories hurt our jobs depress our workers wages and harm our farmers prices not anymore !

kim jong un and north korea tested short range missiles over the last number of days these missiles tests are not a violation of our signed singapore agreement nor was there discussion of short range missiles when we shook hands there may be a united nations violation but
chairman kim does not want to disappoint me with a violation of trust there is far too much for north korea to gain the potential as a country under kim jong un s leadership is unlimited also there is far too much to lose i may be wrong but i believe that
really bad news ! the baltimore house of elijah cummings was robbed too bad !
we look forward to continuing our positive dialogue with china on a comprehensive trade deal and feel that the future between our two countries will be a very bright one !

as usual powell let us down but at least he is ending quantitative tightening which shouldn t have started in the first place no inflation we are winning anyway but i am certainly not getting much help from the federal reserve !

vindication amp exoneration from the russian wikileaks and every other form of hoax perpetrated by the dnc radical democrats and others this is really big stuff especially coming from a highly respected judge who was appointed by president clinton the witch hunt ends !

my team is negotiating with them now but they always change the deal in the end to their benefit they should probably wait out our election to see if we get one of the democrat stiffs like sleepy joe then they could make a great deal like in past years and continue
china is doing very badly worst year in was supposed to start buying our agricultural product now no signs that they are doing so that is the problem with china they just don t come through our economy has become much larger than the chinese economy is last years
despite the democrats wanting very unsafe open borders amp refusing to change the loopholes amp asylum tremendous progress is being made the the southern border we all waited because we assumed the dems would ultimately be forced to change the horrible immigration laws they didn t !
i don t know what it s going to take a lot of democratic run cities all over america look like this it s not just baltimore unfortunately kimberly klacik baltimore journalist remember vote for trump what the h do you have to lose \? best unemployment numbers !
baltimore s numbers are the worst in the united states on crime and the economy billions of dollars have been pumped in over the years but to no avail the money was stolen or wasted ask elijah cummings where it went he should investigate himself with his oversight committee !
elijah cummings never even went to the southern border and then he screams at the very good people who despite congresses failure to fix the loopholes and asylum make it work \( crossings are way down and the wall is being built \) even with zero dem help border getting strong !

the fed raised way too early and way too much their quantitative tightening was another big mistake while our country is doing very well the potential wealth creation that was missed especially when measured against our debt is staggering we are competing with other
countries that know how to play the game against the u s that s actually why the e u was formed and for china until now the u s has been easy pickens the fed has made all of the wrong moves a small rate cut is not enough but we will win anyway !
even to new heights of success and glory but not with king elijah and that crew when the leaders of baltimore want to see the city rise again i am in a very beautiful oval shaped office waiting for your call !
crazy bernie sanders recently equated the city of baltimore to a third world country ! based on that statement i assume that bernie must now be labeled a racist just as a republican would if he used that term and standard ! the fact is baltimore can be brought back maybe
the e u and china will further lower interest rates and pump money into their systems making it much easier for their manufacturers to sell product in the meantime and with very low inflation our fed does nothing and probably will do very little by comparison too bad !
al sharpton would always ask me to go to his events he would say it s a personal favor to me seldom but sometimes i would go it was fine he came to my office in t t during the presidential campaign to apologize for the way he was talking about me just a conman at work !
if the democrats are going to defend the radical left squad and king elijah s baltimore fail it will be a long road to the good news for the dems is that they have the fake news media in their pocket !
baltimore under the leadership of elijah cummings has the worst crime statistics in the nation years of all talk no action ! so tired of listening to the same old bull next reverend al will show up to complain amp protest nothing will get done for the people in need sad !
law enforcement is at the scene of shootings in gilroy california reports are that shooter has not yet been apprehended be careful and safe !

under the trump administration african american unemployment is the lowest \( best \) in the history of the united states no president has come close to doing this before ! i also created successful opportunity zones waiting for nancy and elijah to say thank you mr president !
if racist elijah cummings would focus more of his energy on helping the good people of his district and baltimore itself perhaps progress could be made in fixing the mess that he has helped to create over many years of incompetent leadership his radical oversight is a joke !
there is nothing racist in stating plainly what most people already know that elijah cummings has done a terrible job for the people of his district and of baltimore itself dems always play the race card when they are unable to win with facts shame !
speaking of failing badly has anyone seen what is happening to nancy pelosi s district in san francisco it is not even recognizeable lately something must be done before it is too late the dems should stop wasting time on the witch hunt hoax and start focusing on our country !
someone please explain to nancy pelosi who was recently called racist by those in her own party that there is nothing wrong with bringing out the very obvious fact that congressman elijah cummings has done a very poor job for his district and the city of baltimore just take
a look the facts speak far louder than words ! the democrats always play the race card when in fact they have done so little for our nation s great african american people now lowest unemployment in u s history and only getting better elijah cummings has failed badly !
so sad that elijah cummings has been able to do so little for the people of baltimore statistically baltimore ranks last in almost every major category cummings has done nothing but milk baltimore dry but the public is getting wise to the bad job that he is doing !
robert mueller s testimony and the mueller report itself was a disaster for this illegal democrat inspired witch hunt it is an embarrassment to the usa that they don t know how to stop they can t help themselves they are totally lost they are clowns !
no collusion no obstruction total exoneration democrat witch hunt !
we gave nadler and his trump hating dems the complete mueller report \( we didn t have to \) and even mueller himself but now that both were a total bust they say it wasn t good enough nothing will ever be good enough for them witch hunt !
democrats don t care about border security they refuse to give the votes necessary to fix the loopholes and asylum would be so easy ! they want open borders which means crimecrimecrime !
the dems are now coming out of shock from the terrible mueller performance and are starting to spin impeachment all over again how sick amp disgusting and bad for our country are they what they are doing is so wrong but they do it anyway dems have become the do nothing party !
the democrats were trying mightily to revive the badly amp irrevocably tarnished witch hunt hoax until robert mueller put on the greatest display of ineptitude amp incompetence that the halls of congress have ever seen truth is he had no facts on his side nothing he could do !
consideration is being given to declaring antifa the gutless radical left wack jobs who go around hitting \( only non fighters \) people over the heads with baseball bats a major organization of terror \( along with ms amp others \) would make it easier for police to do their job !
why is so much money sent to the elijah cummings district when it is considered the worst run and most dangerous anywhere in the united states no human being would want to live there where is all this money going \? how much is stolen \? investigate this corrupt mess immediately !
rep elijah cummings has been a brutal bully shouting and screaming at the great men amp women of border patrol about conditions at the southern border when actually his baltimore district is far worse and more dangerous his district is considered the worst in the usa
as proven last week during a congressional tour the border is clean efficient amp well run just very crowded cumming district is a disgusting rat and rodent infested mess if he spent more time in baltimore maybe he could help clean up this very dangerous amp filthy place

i would like to thank the democrats for holding this morning s hearing now after hours robert mueller has to subject himself to shiftyschiff an embarrassment to our country !
it has been reported that robert mueller is saying that he did not apply and interview for the job of fbi director \( and get turned down \) the day before he was wrongfully appointed special counsel hope he doesn t say that under oath in that we have numerous witnesses to the
interview including the vice president of the united states !
interview including the vice president of the united states !
it has been reported that robert mueller is saying that he did not apply and interview for the job of fbi director \( and get turned down \) the day before he was wrongfully appointed special counsel hope he doesn t say that under oath in the we have numerous witnesses to the
so why didn t the highly conflicted robert mueller investigate how and why crooked hillary clinton deleted and acid washed emails immediately after getting a subpoena from the united states congress \? she must have great lawyers !
why didn t robert mueller amp his band of angry democrats spend any time investigating crooked hillary clinton lyin amp leakin james comey lisa page and her psycho lover peter s andy mccabe the beautiful ohr family fusion gps and many more including himself amp andrew w \?
it was never agreed that robert mueller could use one of his many democrat never trumper lawyers to sit next to him and help him with his answers this was specifically not agreed to and i would never have agreed to it the greatest witch hunt in u s history by far !
so democrats and others can illegally fabricate a crime try pinning it on a very innocent president and when he fights back against this illegal and treasonous attack on our country they call it obstruction \? wrong ! why didn t robert mueller investigate the investigators \?
so robert mueller has now asked for his long time never trumper lawyer to sit beside him and help with answers what s this all about \? his lawyer represented the basement server guy who got off free in the crooked hillary case this should not be allowed rigged witch hunt !
just got back only to hear of a last minute change allowing a never trumper attorney to help robert mueller with his testimony before congress tomorrow what a disgrace to our system never heard of this before very unfair should not be allowed a rigged witch hunt !
budget deal gives great victories to our military and vets keeps out democrat poison pill riders republicans and democrats in congress need to act asap and support this deal

but the questions should be asked why were all of clinton s people given immunity and why were the text messages of peter s and his lover lisa page deleted and destroyed right after they left mueller and after we requested them \( this is illegal \) \?
highly conflicted robert mueller should not be given another bite at the apple in the end it will be bad for him and the phony democrats in congress who have done nothing but waste time on this ridiculous witch hunt result of the mueller report no collusion no obstruction !
fake news equals the enemy of the people !
the mainstream media is out of control they constantly lie and cheat in order to get their radical left democrat views out their for all to see it has never been this bad they have gone bonkers amp no longer care what is right or wrong this large scale false reporting is sick !
the amazon washington post front page story yesterday was total fake news they said advisors wrote new talking points and handed him reams of opposition research on the four congresswomen now really does that sound like me \? what advisors there were no talking points
except for those stated by me amp reams of paper were never given to me it is a made up story meant to demean amp belittle the post had no sources the facts remain the same that we have radical left congresswomen who have said very bad things about israel amp our country !
it is far more costly for the federal reserve to cut deeper if the economy actually does in the future turn down ! very inexpensive in fact productive to move now the fed raised amp tightened far too much amp too fast in other words they missed it \( big ! \) don t miss it again !
as we have done it could have been soooo much better interest rate costs should have been much lower amp gdp amp our country s wealth accumulation much higher such a waste of time amp money also very unfair that other countries manipulate their currencies and pump money in !
with almost no inflation our country is needlessly being forced to pay a much higher interest rate than other countries only because of a very misguided federal reserve in addition quantitative tightening is continuing making it harder for our country to compete as good
senator chuck schumer has finally gone to the southern border with some democrat senators this is a great thing ! nearby he missed a large group of illegal immigrants trying to enter the usa illegally they wildly rushed border patrol some agents were badly injured
based on the comments made by senator schumer he must have seen how dangerous amp bad for our country the border is it is not a manufactured crisis as the fake news media amp their democrat partners tried to portray he said he wants to meet i will set up a meeting asap !
most importantly you have led israel with a commitment to the values of democracy freedom and equal opportunity that both our nations cherish and share !
i don t believe the four congresswomen are capable of loving our country they should apologize to america \( and israel \) for the horrible \( hateful \) things they have said they are destroying the democrat party but are weak amp insecure people who can never destroy our great nation !
the washington post story about my speech in north carolina and tweet with its phony sources who do not exist is fake news the only thing people were talking about is the record setting crowd and the tremendous enthusiasm far greater than the democrats you ll see in !
big progress at the border but dems in congress must change the immigration laws for all to be good ! end the loopholes and much more
the great state of west virginia is producing record setting numbers and doing really well when i became president it was practically shut down and closed for business not anymore !
economic numbers reach an all time high the best in our country s history great to be a part of something so good for so many !
our teams will be talking further and we agreed to speak again in the next hours !
fed there is almost no inflation !
i like new york fed president john williams first statement much better than his second his first statement is correct in that the fed raised far too fast amp too early also must stop with the crazy quantitative tightening we are in a world competition amp winning big
but it is no thanks to the federal reserve had they not acted so fast and so much we would be doing even better than we are doing right now this is our chance to build unparalleled wealth and success for the u s growth which would greatly reduce debt don t blow it !
because of the faulty thought process we have going for us at the federal reserve we pay much higher interest rates than countries that are no match for us economically in other words our interest costs are much higher than other countries when they should be lower correct !
he could not have been nicer or more respectful to your favorite president me then i saw the column he wrote trump will be re elected won t he \? he called me a racist which i am not and said rhode island went from economically bad to great in years because the
governor of the state did a good job that may be true but she could not have done it without the tremendous economic success of our country amp the turnaround that my administration has caused really nasty to me in his average i q columns kissed my a on the call phony !
thomas the chin friedman a weak and pathetic sort of guy writes columns for the new york times in between rounds of his favorite game golf two weeks ago while speaking to a friend on his cell phone i unfortunately ended up speaking to friedman we spoke for a while and
mainstream media which has lost all credibility has either officially or unofficially become a part of the radical left democrat party it is a sick partnership so pathetic to watch ! they even covered a tiny staged crowd as they greeted foul mouthed omar in minnesota a
state which i will win in because they can t stand her and her hatred of our country and they appreciate all that i have done for them \( opening up mining and much more \) which has led to the best employment amp economic year in minnesota s long and beautiful history !
it is amazing how the fake news media became crazed over the chant send her back by a packed arena \( a record \) crowd in the great state of north carolina but is totally calm amp accepting of the most vile and disgusting statements made by the three radical left congresswomen

most of the ms gang members indicted amp arrested in l a were illegal aliens of they are said to have killed many people in the most brutal fashion they should never have been allowed in our country for so long years we have arrested and deported thousands
a lot of bad things are happening in puerto rico the governor is under siege the mayor of san juan is a despicable and incompetent person who i wouldn t trust under any circumstance and the united states congress foolishly gave billion dollars for hurricane relief much
of which was squandered away or wasted never to be seen again this is more than twice the amount given to texas amp florida combined i know the people of puerto rico well and they are great but much of their leadership is corrupt amp robbing the u s government blind !
most of the ms gang members indictedand amp arrested in l a were illegal aliens of they are said to have killed many people in the most brutal fashion they should never have been allowed in our country for so long years we have arrested and deported thousands

the democrats in congress are getting nothing done not on drug pricing not on immigration not on infrastructure not on nothing ! sooo much opportunity yet all they want to do is go fishing the american people are tired of the never ending witch hunt they want results now !
opinion they re americans now i m entitled to my opinion amp i just think they re left wing cranks they re the reason there are directions on a shampoo bottle amp we should ignore them the squad has moved the democrat party substantially left and
they are destroying the democrat party i m appalled that so many of our presidential candidates are falling all over themselves to try to agree with the four horsewomen of the apocalypse i m entitled to say that they re wack jobs louisiana senator john kennedy
in america if you hate our country you are free to leave the simple fact of the matter is the four congresswomen think that america is wicked in its origins they think that america is even more wicked now that we are all racist and evil they re entitled to their
visible members of the house democrats who are now wedded to this bitterness and hate the republican vote was wow ! also this was the first time since that the speaker of the house was ruled out of order and broke the rules of the house quite a day !
so great to see how unified the republican party was on today s vote concerning statements i made about four democrat congresswomen if you really want to see statements look at the horrible things they said about our country israel and much more they are now the top most
those tweets were not racist i don t have a racist bone in my body ! the so called vote to be taken is a democrat con game republicans should not show weakness and fall into their trap this should be a vote on the filthy language statements and lies told by the democrat
congresswomen who i truly believe based on their actions hate our country get a list of the horrible things they have said omar is polling at cortez at nancy pelosi tried to push them away but now they are forever wedded to the democrat party see you in !
our country is free beautiful and very successful if you hate our country or if you are not happy here you can leave !
if you come after the president the country the flag he s going to defend himself what the squad doesn t like is that donald trump is enforcing the very laws that are on the books that were put there by congress jason chaffetz also buy jason s great new book power grab !
the democrat congresswomen have been spewing some of the most vile hateful and disgusting things ever said by a politician in the house or senate amp yet they get a free pass and a big embrace from the democrat party horrible anti israel anti usa pro terrorist amp public
shouting of the f word among many other terrible things and the petrified dems run for the hills why isn t the house voting to rebuke the filthy and hate laced things they have said \? because they are the radical left and the democrats are afraid to take them on sad !
the obama administration built the cages not the trump administration ! democrats must give us the votes to change bad immigration laws
the dems were trying to distance themselves from the four progressives but now they are forced to embrace them that means they are endorsing socialism hate of israel and the usa ! not good for the democrats !
they are anti israel pro al qaeda and comment on the attack some people did something radical left democrats want open borders which means drugs crime human trafficking and much more
detention facilities are not concentration camps ! america has never been stronger than it is now rebuilt military highest stock market ever lowest unemployment and more people working than ever before keep america great !
we will never be a socialist or communist country if you are not happy here you can leave ! it is your choice and your choice alone this is about love for america certain people hate our country
we all know that aoc and this crowd are a bunch of communists they hate israel they hate our own country they re calling the guards along our border \( the border patrol agents \) concentration camp guards they accuse people who support israel as doing it for the benjamin s
they are anti semitic they are anti america we don t need to know anything about them personally talk about their policies i think they are american citizens who are duly elected that are running on an agenda that is disgusting that the american people will reject
what does it mean for america to have free healthcare for illegal immigrants no criminalization of coming into our country see how that works for controlling immigration ! they talk about israel like they re a bunch of thugs not victims of the entire region they wanted
if democrats want to unite around the foul language amp racist hatred spewed from the mouths and actions of these very unpopular amp unrepresentative congresswomen it will be interesting to see how it plays out i can tell you that they have made israel feel abandoned by the u s
when will the radical left congresswomen apologize to our country the people of israel and even to the office of the president for the foul language they have used and the terrible things they have said so many people are angry at them amp their horrible amp disgusting actions !
with the u s and wishes it had not broken the original deal in the first place in the meantime we are receiving billions of dollars in tariffs from china with possibly much more to come these tariffs are paid for by china devaluing amp pumping not by the u s taxpayer !
china s nd quarter growth is the slowest it has been in more than years the united states tariffs are having a major effect on companies wanting to leave china for non tariffed countries thousands of companies are leaving this is why china wants to make a deal
we are doing great economically as a country number one despite the fed s antiquated policy on rates and tightening much room to grow !
and the many terrible things they say about the united states must not be allowed to go unchallenged if the democrat party wants to continue to condone such disgraceful behavior then we look even more forward to seeing you at the ballot box in !
so sad to see the democrats sticking up for people who speak so badly of our country and who in addition hate israel with a true and unbridled passion whenever confronted they call their adversaries including nancy pelosi racist their disgusting language
sorry can t let them into our country if too crowded tell them not to come to usa and tell the dems to fix the loopholes problem solved !
so interesting to see progressive democrat congresswomen who originally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe the worst most corrupt and inept anywhere in the world \( if they even have a functioning government at all \) now loudly
and viciously telling the people of the united states the greatest and most powerful nation on earth how our government is to be run why don t they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came then come back and show us how
it is done these places need your help badly you can t leave fast enough i m sure that nancy pelosi would be very happy to quickly work out free travel arrangements !
a big risk of major flooding in large parts of louisiana and all across the gulf coast please be very careful !
approval rating in the republican party an all time high ronald reagan was thank you !
house minority leader kevin mccarthy is a far superior leader than was lame duck speaker paul ryan tougher smarter and a far better fundraiser kevin is already closing in on million dollars paul s final year numbers were according to breitbart abysmal people like
paul ryan almost killed the republican party weak ineffective amp stupid are not exactly the qualities that republicans or the citizens of our country were looking for right now our spirit is at an all time high far better than the radical left dems you ll see next year !

alex was a great secretary of labor and his service is truly appreciated he will be replaced on an acting basis by pat pizzella the current deputy secretary
alex acosta informed me this morning that he felt the constant drumbeat of press about a prosecution which took place under his watch more than years ago was bad for the administration which he so strongly believes in and he graciously tendered his resignation
companies to come to the usa and to get companies that have left us for other lands to come back home we stupidly lost of our auto business to mexico if the tariffs went on at the higher level they would all come back and fast but very happy with the deal i made
if mexico produces \( which i think they will \) biggest part of deal with mexico has not yet been revealed ! china is similar except they devalue currency amp subsidize companies to lessen effect of tariffs so far little effect to consumers companies will relocate to u s
when you are the big piggy bank that other countries have been ripping off for years \( to a level that is not to be believed \) tariffs are a great negotiating tool a great revenue producer and most importantly a powerful way to get
he had the majority amp blew it away with his poor leadership and bad timing never knew how to go after the dems like they go after us couldn t get him out of congress fast enough !
paul ryan the failed v p candidate amp former speaker of the house whose record of achievement was atrocious \( except during my first two years as president \) ultimately became a long running lame duck failure leaving his party in the lurch both as a fundraiser amp leader
when mitt chose paul i told people that s the end of that presidential run he quit congress because he didn t know how to win they gave me standing o s in the great state of wisconsin amp booed him off the stage he promised me the wall amp failed \( happening anyway ! \)
similarly facebook libra s virtual currency will have little standing or dependability if facebook and other companies want to become a bank they must seek a new banking charter and become subject to all banking regulations just like other banks both national
and international we have only one real currency in the usa and it is stronger than ever both dependable and reliable it is by far the most dominant currency anywhere in the world and it will always stay that way it is called the united states dollar !
i am not a fan of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies which are not money and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air unregulated crypto assets can facilitate unlawful behavior including drug trade and other illegal activity
years or maybe or \( just kidding \) they will quickly go out of business for lack of credibility or approval from the public that s why they will all be endorsing me at some point one way or the other could you imagine having sleepy joe biden or alfred e newman
or a very nervous and skinny version of pocahontas \( th \) as your president rather than what you have now so great looking and smart a true stable genius ! sorry to say that even social media would be driven out of business along with and finally the fake news media !
a big subject today at the white house social media summit will be the tremendous dishonesty bias discrimination and suppression practiced by certain companies we will not let them get away with it much longer the fake news media will also be there but for a limited period
the fake news is not as important or as powerful as social media they have lost tremendous credibility since that day in november that i came down the escalator with the person who was to become your future first lady when i ultimately leave office in six
so happy that i was able to keep sikorsky helicopter in the great state of pennsylvania keep america great !
dow just hit for first time ever !
mexico is doing great at the border but china is letting us down in that they have not been buying the agricultural products from our great farmers that they said they would hopefully they will start soon !
will be a big and exciting day at the white house for social media !
now the democrats have asked to see more people who have already spent hours with robert mueller and spent a fortune on lawyers in so doing how many bites at the apple do they get before working on border loopholes and asylum they also want to interview the highly
conflicted and compromised mueller again he said he was done after his last minute speech and that he had nothing more to say outside of the no collusion no obstruction report enough already go back to work ! i won unanimously the big emoluments case yesterday !
and remember a bank that i did use years ago the now badly written about and maligned deutsche bank was then one of the largest and most prestigious banks in the world ! they wanted my business and so did many others !
the fake news media loves the narrative that i didn t use many banks because the banks didn t like me no i didn t use many banks because i didn t \( don t \) need their money \( old fashioned isn t it \? \) if i did it would have been very easy for me to get
robert johnson b e t i give the president a lot of credit for moving the economy in a positive direction that s benefiting a large number of americans i think the tax cuts clearly helped stimulate the economy overall if you look at the u s economy and you look at
the number of people who are no longer looking for jobs but who are now seeing the opportunity for job growth you ve got to give the president an a plus for that thank you robert one of our great business leaders !
nearly one million more blacks and two million more hispanics are employed than when barrack obama left office and minorities account for more than half of all new jobs created during the trump presidency unemployment among black women has hovered near for the last six

the fake news is not as important or as powerful as social media they have lost tremendous credibility since that day in november that i came down the escalator with the person who was to become your future first lady when i ultimately leave office in six
or a very nervous and skinny version of pocahontas \( th \) as your president rather than what you have now so great looking and smart a true stable genius ! sorry to say that even social media would be driven out of business along with and finally the fake news media !
a big subject today at the white house social media summit will be the tremendous dishonesty bias discrimination and suppression practiced by certain companies we will not let them get away with it much longer the fake news media will also be there but for a limited period
the white house will be hosting a very big and very important social media summit today would i have become president without social media \? yes \( probably \) ! at its conclusion we will all go to the beautiful rose garden for a news conference on the census and citizenship
thank you to lockheed martin one of the usa s truly great companies !
i was just informed by marillyn hewson ceo of lockheed martin of her decision to keep the sikorsky helicopter plant in coatesville pennsylvania open and humming ! we are very proud of pennsylvania and the people who work there

serving and doing a great job as your president \( including accepting zero salary ! \)
iran has long been secretly enriching in total violation of the terrible billion dollar deal made by john kerry and the obama administration remember that deal was to expire in a short number of years sanctions will soon be increased substantially !
done a great job of reducing crime in the african american community because more african americans are at work today trump is not a racist he s a businessman because he s a great businessman he s pushing for lives to be better michael brown ceo hydromatic tech
our company has grown since trump has taken control of the white house amp the presidency in the sense that we have better opportunities now to do what we ve been wanting to do for quite some time and that is to create manufacturing jobs i believe that president trump has
so now the obama appointed judge on the census case \( are you a citizen of the united states \? \) won t let the justice department use the lawyers that it wants to use could this be a first \?
more and more the radical left is using commerce to hurt their enemy they put out the name of a store brand or company and ask their so called followers not to do business there they don t care who gets hurt but also don t understand that two can play that game !
a truly great patriotic amp charitable man bernie marcus the co founder of home depot who at the age of is coming under attack by the radical left democrats with one of their often used weapons they don t want people to shop at those great stores because he contributed
to your favorite president me ! these people are vicious and totally crazed but remember there are far more great people \( deplorables \) in this country than bad do to them what they do to you fight for bernie marcus and home depot !
why would kentucky ever think of giving up the most powerful position in congress the senate majority leader for a freshman senator with little power in what will hopefully be the minority party we need mitch in the senate to keep america great ! !
democrats are coming after our great kentucky senator mitch mcconnell with someone who compared my election to september th
recent strained decisions by the united states supreme court some so simple as allowing the question are you a citizen of the united states on our very expensive census report or the even more strained decisions \( \) allowing the world s most expensive amp pathetic
healthcare \( obamacare \) to stay in place when it would have been replaced by something far better shows how incredibly important our upcoming election is i have long heard that the appointment of supreme court justices is a president s most important decision so true !
india has long had a field day putting tariffs on american products no longer acceptable !
the wacky ambassador that the u k foisted upon the united states is not someone we are thrilled with a very stupid guy he should speak to his country and prime minister may about their failed brexit negotiation and not be upset with my criticism of how badly it was
and they are both only getting bigger better and stronger thank you mr president !
very good numbers on the economy much potential for growth trade deals being negotiated or being set up for negotiation we have been treated very unfairly \( to put it mildly \) by other countries for many years but that is changing !
i have been very critical about the way the u k and prime minister theresa may handled brexit what a mess she and her representatives have created i told her how it should be done but she decided to go another way i do not know the ambassador but he is not liked or well
thought of within the u s we will no longer deal with him the good news for the wonderful united kingdom is that they will soon have a new prime minister while i thoroughly enjoyed the magnificent state visit last month it was the queen who i was most impressed with !
we are building the wall now but the reason the badly needed wall wasn t approved in the republican controlled house and senate was that we had a very slim majority in the senate amp needed democrat votes they were totally unwilling to give wall votes to us want open borders !
united states citizens first border patrol and others in law enforcement have been doing a great job we said there was a crisis the fake news amp the dems said it was manufactured now all agree we were right but they always knew that they are crowded \( which we
brought up not them \) because the dems won t change the loopholes and asylum big media con job !
congratulations to the u s women s soccer team on winning the world cup ! great and exciting play america is proud of you all !
last year was the first in years where prescription drug prices actually went down but things have been and are being put in place that will drive them down substantially if dems would work with us in a bipartisan fashion we would get big results very fast !
sleepy joe biden just admitted he worked with segregationists and separately has already been very plain about the fact that he will be substantially raising everyone s taxes if he becomes president ridiculously all democrats want to substantially raise taxes !
joe biden is a reclamation project some things are just not salvageable china and other countries that ripped us off for years are begging for him he deserted our military our law enforcement and our healthcare added more debt than all other presidents combined won t win !
as well as we are doing from the day after the great election when the market shot right up it could have been even better massive additional wealth would have been created amp used very well our most difficult problem is not our competitors it is the federal reserve !
strong jobs report low inflation and other countries around the world doing anything possible to take advantage of the united states knowing that our federal reserve doesn t have a clue ! they raised rates too soon too often amp tightened while others did just the opposite

if illegal immigrants are unhappy with the conditions in the quickly built or refitted detentions centers just tell them not to come all problems solved !

our border patrol people are not hospital workers doctors or nurses the democrats bad immigration laws which could be easily fixed are the problem great job by border patrol above and beyond many of these illegals aliens are living far better now than where they
came from and in far safer conditions no matter how good things actually look even if perfect the democrat visitors will act shocked amp aghast at how terrible things are just pols if they really want to fix them change the immigration laws and loopholes so easy to do !
the news reports about the department of commerce dropping its quest to put the citizenship question on the census is incorrect or to state it differently fake ! we are absolutely moving forward as we must because of the importance of the answer to this question
congratulations to navy seal eddie gallagher his wonderful wife andrea and his entire family you have been through much together glad i could help !

to do whatever is necessary to bring this most vital of questions and this very important case to a successful conclusion usa ! usa ! usa !

united states supreme court is given additional information from which it can make a final and decisive decision on this very critical matter can anyone really believe that as a great country we are not able the ask whether or not someone is a citizen only in america !

just another abuse of power in a long series of abuses of power by the democrats that began during the obama administration continued through the mueller fbi operation amp now the baton has been passed to jerry nadler to continue to abuse power to harass president trump
and the democrat national committee the democrat party apparatus has been caught using donor dollars to collude with russian intelligence to attack a domestic political opponent \( me \) the fbi has no leadership the director is protecting the same gang that tried to
china is dreaming that sleepy joe biden or any of the others gets elected in they love ripping off america !
the constitutional crisis is the democrats refusing to work let them start by fixing the mess that their immigration laws have caused at the southern border
when the mueller report came out showing no collusion with russia \( of course \) it was supposed to be over back to work for the people but the dems have gone nuts and it has actually gotten worse ! hope the republicans win back the house in or little will get done !
ever since the mueller report showed no collusion amp no obstruction the dems have been working overtime to damage me and the republican party by issuing over demands for documents and testimonies and with no reason that s all they want to do don t care about anything else !
despite two years and millions of dollars spent the democrats are acting like crazed lunatics ever since the results of the mueller report were made public but they knew there was nothing even before the report was started it is all a big hoax the biggest in american history !
the democrats new and pathetically untrue sound bite is that we are in a constitutional crisis they and their partner the fake news media are all told to say this as loud and as often as possible they are a sad joke ! we may have the strongest economy in our history best
employment numbers ever low taxes amp regulations a rebuilt military amp v a many great new judges amp so much more but we have had a giant scam perpetrated upon our nation a witch hunt a treasonous hoax that is the constitutional crisis amp hopefully guilty people will pay !
we are right where we want to be with china remember they broke the deal with us amp tried to renegotiate we will be taking in tens of billions of dollars in tariffs from china buyers of product can make it themselves in the usa \( ideal \) or buy it from non tariffed countries
we will then spend \( match or better \) the money that china may no longer be spending with our great patriot farmers \( agriculture \) which is a small percentage of total tariffs received and distribute the food to starving people in nations around the world ! great ! maga
big attacks on republicans and conservatives by social media not good !
think of it i became president of the united states in one of the most hard fought and consequential elections in the history of our great nation from long before i ever took office i was under a sick amp unlawful investigation concerning what has become known as the russian
hoax my campaign was being seriously spied upon by intel agencies and the democrats this never happened before in american history and it all turned out to be a total scam a witch hunt that yielded no collusion no obstruction this must never be allowed to happen again !
the democrats have nothing just want to distract from this president the fbi was not doing its job the state department was covering things up everyday for hillary at the end of the day they re fearful of what they did and should be fearful this is a tough
i was not going to fire bob mueller and did not fire bob mueller in fact he was allowed to finish his report with unprecedented help from the trump administration actually lawyer don mcgahn had a much better chance of being fired than mueller never a big fan !
the only problem is that they know i am going to win \( best economy amp employment numbers in u s history amp much more \) and the deal will become far worse for them if it has to be negotiated in my second term would be wise for them to act now but love collecting big tariffs !
i think that china felt they were being beaten so badly in the recent negotiation that they may as well wait around for the next election to see if they could get lucky amp have a democrat win in which case they would continue to rip off the usa for billion a year
so now the radical left dems don t talk about collusion anymore because the mueller report said there was no collusion they only want to talk about obstruction even though there was no obstruction or no crime except for the crimes committed by the other side !
i won the election partially based on no tax returns while i am under audit \( which i still am \) and the voters didn t care now the radical left democrats want to again relitigate this matter make it a part of the election !

the fake news media is doing everything possible to stir up and anger the pols and as many people as possible seldom mentioning the fact that the mueller report had as its principle conclusion the fact that there was no collusion with russia the russia hoax is dead !
despite the fact that the mueller report should not have been authorized in the first place amp was written as nastily as possible by \( \) angry democrats who were true trump haters including highly conflicted bob mueller himself the end result is no collusion no obstruction !
big fat waste of time energy and money to be exact it is now finally time to turn the tables and bring justice to some very sick and dangerous people who have committed very serious crimes perhaps even spying or treason this should never happen again !
agreed to testify it was not necessary for me to respond to statements made in the report about me some of which are total bullshit amp only given to make the other person look good \( or me to look bad \) this was an illegally started hoax that never should have happened a
statements are made about me by certain people in the crazy mueller report in itself written by angry democrat trump haters which are fabricated amp totally untrue watch out for people that take so called notes when the notes never existed until needed because i never
anything the russians did concerning the election was done while obama was president he was told about it and did nothing ! most importantly the vote was not affected
the greatest political hoax of all time ! crimes were committed by crooked dirty cops and dnc the democrats
democrats in congress must return from their vacations and change the immigration laws or the border despite the great job being done by border patrol will only get worse big sections of wall now being built !
i believe it will be crazy bernie sanders vs sleepy joe biden as the two finalists to run against maybe the best economy in the history of our country \( and many other great things \) ! i look forward to facing whoever it may be may god rest their soul !

no collusion no obstruction !

so horrible to watch the massive fire at notre dame cathedral in paris perhaps flying water tankers could be used to put it out must act quickly !
heading to the great state of minnesota !
since there was no collusion why was there an investigation in the first place ! answer dirty cops dems and crooked hillary !
the mueller report which was written by angry democrats who also happen to be trump haters \( and clinton supporters \) should have focused on the people who spied on my campaign and others who fabricated the whole russia hoax that is never forget the crime
those illegal immigrants who can no longer be legally held \( congress must fix the laws and loopholes \) will be subject to homeland security given to sanctuary cities and states !
mark morgan president obama s border patrol chief gave the following message to me president trump stay the course i agree and believe it or not we are making great progress with a system that has been broken for many years !
the radical left democrats will never be satisfied with anything we give them they will always resist and obstruct !
they spied on my campaign \( we will never forget \) !
before nancy who has lost all control of congress and is getting nothing done decides to defend her leader rep omar she should look at the anti semitic anti israel and ungrateful u s hate statements omar has made she is out of control except for her control of nancy !
congress should come back to d c now and fix the immigration laws !
mueller and the a g based on mueller findings \( and great intelligence \) have already ruled no collusion no obstruction these were crimes committed by crooked hillary the dnc dirty cops and others ! investigate the investigators !
what do i know about branding maybe nothing \( but i did become president ! \) but if i were boeing i would fix the boeing max add some additional great features amp rebrand the plane with a new name no product has suffered like this one but again what the hell do i know \?
if the fed had done its job properly which it has not the stock market would have been up to additional points and gdp would have been well over instead of with almost no inflation quantitative tightening was a killer should have done the exact opposite !
just out the usa has the absolute legal right to have apprehended illegal immigrants transferred to sanctuary cities we hereby demand that they be taken care of at the highest level especially by the state of california which is well known or its poor management amp high taxes !
democrats must change the immigration laws fast if not sanctuary cities must immediately act to take care of the illegal immigrants and this includes gang members drug dealers human traffickers and criminals of all shapes sizes and kinds change the laws now !
so interesting to see the mayor of oakland and other sanctuary cities not want our currently detained immigrants after release due to the ridiculous court ordered day rule if they don t want to serve our nation by taking care of them why should other cities amp towns \?
i never offered pardons to homeland security officials never ordered anyone to close our southern border \( although i have the absolute right to do so and may if mexico does not apprehend the illegals coming to our border \) and am not frustrated it is all fake amp corrupt news !
the new york times sanctuary cities immigration story today was knowingly wrong on almost every fact they never call to check for truth their sources often don t even exist a fraud they will lie amp cheat anyway possible to make me look bad in years they will be gone
why should radical left democrats in congress have a right to retry and examine the \( two years in the making \) no collusion mueller report when the crime committed was by crooked hillary the dnc and dirty cops \? attorney general barr will make the decision !
extraordinary growth economic success and riches under the leadership of chairman kim i look forward to the day which could be soon when nuclear weapons and sanctions can be removed and then watching north korea become one of the most successful nations of the world !
i agree with kim jong un of north korea that our personal relationship remains very good perhaps the term excellent would be even more accurate and that a third summit would be good in that we fully understand where we each stand north korea has tremendous potential for
in new york state democrats blocked a bill expanding college tuition for gold star families after approving aid for illegal immigrants no wonder so many people are leaving n y very sad !
if the radical left democrats all of a sudden don t want the illegal migrants in their sanctuary cities \( no more open arms \) why should others be expected to take them into their communities \? go home and come into our country legally and through a system of merit !
due to the fact that democrats are unwilling to change our very dangerous immigration laws we are indeed as reported giving strong considerations to placing illegal immigrants in sanctuary cities only
the radical left always seems to have an open borders open arms policy so this should make them very happy !
even the democrats now say that our southern border is a crisis and a national emergency hopefully we will not be getting any more bad \( outrageous \) court decisions !
jobless claims at year low !
house democrats want to negotiate a trillion spending increase but can t even pass their own plan we can t afford it anyway and it s not happening !
too bad that the european union is being so tough on the united kingdom and brexit the e u is likewise a brutal trading partner with the united states which will change sometimes in life you have to let people breathe before it all comes back to bite you !
i think what the democrats are doing with the border is treasonous their open border mindset is putting our country at risk will not let this happen !
so it has now been determined by people that truly hate president trump that there was no collusion with russia in fact it was an illegal investigation that should never have been allowed to start i fought back hard against this phony amp treasonous hoax !
everybody is now acknowledging that right from the time i announced my run for president i was correct on the border remember the heat i took \? democrats should now get rid of the loopholes the border is being fixed mexico will not let people through !
the democrats must end the loopholes on immigration so easy to solve !
the mainstream media has never been more inaccurate or corrupt than it is today it only seems to get worse so much fake news !
i got along very well with jerry during the zoning and building process then i changed course \( slightly \) became president and now i am dealing with congressman nadler again some things never end but hopefully it will all go well for everyone only time will tell !
congressman jerry nadler fought me for years on a very large development i built on the west side of manhattan he wanted a rail yard built underneath the development or even better to stop the job he didn t get either amp the development became very successful nevertheless
the world trade organization finds that the european union subsidies to airbus has adversely impacted the united states which will now put tariffs on billion of eu products ! the eu has taken advantage of the u s on trade for many years it will soon stop !

uganda must find the kidnappers of the american tourist and guide before people will feel safe in going there bring them to justice openly and quickly !
the reason the whole process seems so politicized is that democrats made up this complete lie about collusion and none of it happened charles hurt the russian hoax never happened it was a fraud on the american people !
mexico must apprehend all illegals and not let them make the long march up to the united states or we will have no other choice than to close the border and or institute tariffs our country is full !
more apprehensions \( captures \) at the southern border than in many years border patrol amazing ! country is full ! system has been broken for many years democrats in congress must agree to fix loopholes no open borders \( crimes amp drugs \) will close southern border if necessary
secretary of homeland security kirstjen nielsen will be leaving her position and i would like to thank her for her service
pleased to report that the american tourist and tour guide that were abducted in uganda have been released god bless them and their families !
looks like bob mueller s team of trump haters amp angry democrats are illegally leaking information to the press while the fake news media make up their own stories with or without sources sources no longer matter to our corrupt amp dishonest mainstream media they are a joke !
in the meantime the democrats in congress must help the republicans \( we need their votes \) to end the horrible costly and foolish loopholes in our immigration laws once that happens all will be smooth we can never allow open borders !
it s powerful common sense immigration laws to stop illegals from coming through mexico into the u s and removing them back to their country of origin until mexico cleans up this ridiculous amp massive migration we will be focusing on border security not ports of entry
we have redeployed agents at the southern border s specific ports of entry in order to help with the large scale surge of illegal migrants trying to make their way into the united states this will cause traffic amp commercial delays until such time as mexico is able to use
why should i be defending a fraudulent russian witch hunt it s about time the perpetrators of this fraud on me and the american people start defending their dishonest and treasonous acts how and why did this terrible event begin \? never forget !
against something i knew never existed collusion with russia \( so ridiculous ! \) no obstruction this russia hoax must never happen to another president and law enforcement must find out how did it start \?
so let s get this straight ! there was no collusion and in fact the phony dossier was a con job that was paid for by crooked hillary and the dnc so the angry democrats were investigating an event that never happened and that was in fact a made up fraud i just fought back
so let s get this straight ! there was no collusion and in fact the phony dossier was a con job that was paid for by crooked hillary and the dnc so the angry democrats were investigating an event that never happened and that was in fact a made up fraud i just fought back

i ve employed thousands of electrical workers they will be voting for me !

this will supersede usmca likewise i am looking at an economic penalty for the billion dollars in illegal drugs that are shipped and smuggled through mexico and across our southern border over americans die each year sooo many families destroyed !
however if for any reason mexico stops apprehending and bringing the illegals back to where they came from the u s will be forced to tariff at all cars made in mexico and shipped over the border to us if that doesn t work which it will i will close the border
the crazed and dishonest washington post again purposely got it wrong mexico for the first time in decades is meaningfully apprehending illegals at their southern border before the long march up to the u s this is great and the way it should be the big flow will stop
the new york times had no legitimate sources which would be totally illegal concerning the mueller report in fact they probably had no sources at all ! they are a fake news paper who have already been forced to apologize for their incorrect and very bad reporting on me !
there is nothing we can ever give to the democrats that will make them happy this is the highest level of presidential harassment in the history of our country !
according to polling few people seem to care about the russian collusion hoax but some democrats are fighting hard to keep the witch hunt alive they should focus on legislation or even better an investigation of how the ridiculous collusion delusion got started so illegal !
despite the unnecessary and destructive actions taken by the fed the economy is looking very strong the china and usmca deals are moving along nicely there is little or no inflation and usa optimism is very high !
the republican party is the party of the american dream !
congress must get together and immediately eliminate the loopholes at the border ! if no action border or large sections of border will close this is a national emergency !
i was never planning a vote prior to the election on the wonderful healthcare package that some very talented people are now developing for me amp the republican party it will be on full display during the election as a much better amp less expensive alternative to obamacare
i haven t seen any democrats down here at the border working with us or asking to speak to any of us they have an open invitation we are getting overrun our facilities are overcapacity we are at an emergency crisis art del cueto national border patrol council
after many years \( decades \) mexico is apprehending large numbers of people at their southern border mostly from guatemala honduras and el salvador they have all been taking u s money for years and doing absolutely nothing for us just like the democrats in congress !
there is no amount of testimony or document production that can satisfy jerry nadler or shifty adam schiff it is now time to focus exclusively on properly running our great country !
robert mueller was a god like figure to the democrats until he ruled no collusion in the long awaited mueller report now the dems don t even acknowledge his name have become totally unhinged and would like to go through the whole process again it won t happen !
the best thing that ever happened to puerto rico is president donald j trump so many wonderful people but with such bad island leadership and with so much money wasted cannot continue to hurt our farmers and states with these massive payments and so little appreciation !
puerto rico got billion dollars for the hurricane more money than has ever been gotten for a hurricane before amp all their local politicians do is complain amp ask for more money the pols are grossly incompetent spend the money foolishly or corruptly amp only take from usa
the crazed and incompetent mayor of san juan have done such a poor job of bringing the island back to health billion dollars to puerto rico and now the dems want to give them more taking dollars away from our farmers and so many others disgraceful !
are great but the politicians are incompetent or corrupt puerto rico got far more money than texas amp florida combined yet their government can t do anything right the place is a mess nothing works fema amp the military worked emergency miracles but politicians like
the democrats today killed a bill that would have provided great relief to farmers and yet more money to puerto rico despite the fact that puerto rico has already been scheduled to receive more hurricane relief funding than any place in history the people of puerto rico
back the house it will be truly great healthcare that will work for america also republicans will always support pre existing conditions the republican party will be known as the party of great healtcare meantime the usa is doing better than ever amp is respected again !
are developing a really great healthcare plan with far lower premiums \( cost \) amp deductibles than obamacare in other words it will be far less expensive amp much more usable than obamacare vote will be taken right after the election when republicans hold the senate amp win
everybody agrees that obamacare doesn t work premiums amp deductibles are far too high really bad healthcare ! even the dems want to replace it but with medicare for all which would cause million americans to lose their beloved private health insurance the republicans
democrats should stop fighting sen david perdue s disaster relief bill they are blocking funding and relief for our great farmers and rural america !
no matter what information is given to the crazed democrats from the no collusion mueller report it will never be good enough behind closed doors the dems are laughing !
can you believe that the radical left democrats want to do our new and very important census report without the all important citizenship question report would be meaningless and a waste of the billions \( ridiculous \) that it costs to put together !
democrats working with republicans in congress can fix the asylum and other loopholes quickly we have a major national emergency at our border get it done now !
now that the long awaited mueller report conclusions have been released most democrats and othershave gone back to the pre witch hunt phase of their lives before collusion delusion took over others are pretending that their former hero bob mueller no longer exists !
the democrats are allowing a ridiculous asylum system and major loopholes to remain as a mainstay of our immigration system mexico is likewise doing nothing a very bad combination for our country homeland security is being sooo very nice but not for long !
everybody is asking how the phony and fraudulent investigation of the no collusion no obstruction trump campaign began we need to know for future generations to understand this hoax should never be allowed to happen to another president or administration again !
mexico must use its very strong immigration laws to stop the many thousands of people trying to get into the usa our detention areas are maxed out amp we will take no more illegals next step is to close the border ! this will also help us with stopping the drug flow from mexico !
it would be so easy to fix our weak and very stupid democrat inspired immigration laws in less than one hour and then a vote the problem would be solved but the dems don t care about the crime they don t want any victory for trump and the republicans even if good for usa !
so funny that the new york times amp the washington post got a pulitzer prize for their coverage \( negative and fake ! \) of collusion with russia and there was no collusion ! so they were either duped or corrupt \? in any event their prizes should be taken away by the committee !
the problem is no matter what the radical left democrats get no matter what we give them it will never be enough just watch they will harass amp complain amp resist \( the theme of their movement \) so maybe we should just take our victory and say no we ve got a country to run !
robert mueller was a hero to the radical left democrats until he ruled that there was no collusion with russia \( so ridiculous to even say ! \) after more than two years since the insurance policy statement was made by a dirty cop i got the answers i wanted the truth
had the fed not mistakenly raised interest rates especially since there is very little inflation and had they not done the ridiculously timed quantitative tightening the gdp amp stock market would have both been much higher amp world markets would be in a better place !
the border or large sections of the border next week this would be so easy for mexico to do but they just take our money and talk besides we lose so much money with them especially when you add in drug trafficking etc \) that the border closing would be a good thing !
through their country and our southern border mexico has for many years made a fortune off of the u s far greater than border costs if mexico doesn t immediately stop all illegal immigration coming into the united states throug our southern border i will be closing
the democrats have given us the weakest immigration laws anywhere in the world mexico has the strongest amp they make more than billion a year on the u s therefore congress must change our weak immigration laws now amp mexico must stop illegals from entering the u s
on this vietnam war veterans day we celebrate the brave vietnam veterans and all of america s veterans thank you for your service to our great nation !

just the large states the cities would end up running the country smaller states amp the entire midwest would end up losing all power amp we can t let that happen i used to like the idea of the popular vote but now realize the electoral college is far better for the u s a
campaigning for the popular vote is much easier amp different than campaigning for the electoral college it s like training for the yard dash vs a marathon the brilliance of the electoral college is that you must go to many states to win with the popular vote you go to

so if there was knowingly amp acknowledged to be zero crime when the special counsel was appointed and if the appointment was made based on the fake dossier \( paid for by crooked hillary \) and now disgraced andrew mccabe \( he amp all stated no crime \) then the special counsel

matt schlapp and cpac are getting ready for another exciting event big difference from those days when president obama held the white house you ve come a long way matt !
republicans are now leading the generic poll perhaps because of the popular tax cuts which the dems want to take away actually they want to raise you taxes substantially also they want to do nothing on daca r s want to fix !
the president obama quote just before election that s because he thought crooked hillary was going to win and he didn t want to rock the boat when i easily won the electoral college the whole game changed and the russian excuse became the narrative of the dems
there is no serious person out there who would suggest somehow that you could even rig america s elections there s no evidence that that has happened in the past or that it will happen this time and so i d invite mr trump to stop whining and make his case to get votes

now that adam schiff is starting to blame president obama for russian meddling in the election he is probably doing so as yet another excuse that the democrats lead by their fearless leader crooked hillary clinton lost the election but wasn t i a great candidate \?
i never said russia did not meddle in the election i said it may be russia or china or another country or group or it may be a pound genius sitting in bed and playing with his computer the russian hoax was that the trump campaign colluded with russia it never did !
finally liddle adam schiff the leakin monster of no control is now blaming the obama administration for russian meddling in the election he is finally right about something obama was president knew of the threat and did nothing thank you adam !
never gotten over the fact that obama was able to send billion dollars in cash to iran and nobody in congress the fbi or justice called for an investigation !

republicans want to fix daca far more than the democrats do the dems had all three branches of government back in and they decided not to do anything about daca they only want to use it as a campaign issue vote republican !
my view is that not only has trump been vindicated in the last several weeks about the mishandling of the dossier and the lies about the clinton dnc dossier it shows that he s been victimized he s been victimized by the obama administration who were using all sorts of
peoples lives are being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation some are true and some are false some are old and some are new there is no recovery for someone falsely accused life and career are gone is there no such thing any longer as due process \?

the new joke in town is that russia leaked the disastrous dnc e mails which should never have been written \( stupid \) because putin likes me
watched crooked hillary clinton and tim kaine on minutes no way they are going to fix america 's problems isis amp all others laughing !
the ratings for the republican national convention were very good but for the final night my speech great thank you !
the highly neurotic debbie wasserman schultz is angry that after stealing and cheating her way to a crooked hillary victory she 's out !
the democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing ! e mails say the rigged system is alive amp well !
even though bernie sanders has lost his energy and his strength i do n't believe that his supporters will let crooked hillary off the hook !
crooked hillary clinton was not at all loyal to the person in her rigged system that pushed her over the top dws too bad bernie flamed out
if the republican convention had blown up with e mails resignation of boss and the beat down of a big player \( bernie \) media would go wild
i always said that debbie wasserman schultz was overrated the dems convention is cracking up and bernie is exhausted no energy left !
sorry folks but bernie sanders is exhausted just ca n't go on any longer he is trying to dismiss the new e mails and dnc disrespect sad !
there is no longer a bernie sanders political revolution he is turning out to be a weak and somewhat pathetic figurewants it all to end !
an analysis showed that bernie sanders would have won the democratic nomination if it were not for the super delegates
looks like the bernie people will fight if not their blood sweat and tears was a total waste of time kaine stands for opposite !
wow president obama 's brother malik just announced that he is voting for me was probably treated badly by president like everybody else !
bernie sanders started off strong but with the selection of kaine for v p is ending really weak so much for a movement ! total disrespect
the crooked hillary v p choice is very disrespectful to bernie sanders and all of his supporters just another case of bad judgement by h !
thank you to everyone for the wonderful reviews of my speech on thursday night from the heart !
the wikileaks e mail release today was so bad to sanders that it will make it impossible for him to support her unless he is a fraud !
just saw crooked hillary and tim kaine together isis and our other enemies are drooling they do n't look presidential to me !
i will bring jobs back and get wages up people have n't had a real wage increase in almost twenty years clinton killed jobs !
tim kaine has been praising the trans pacific partnership and has been pushing hard to get it approved job killer !
funny that the democrats would have their convention in pennsylvania where her husband and her killed so many jobs i will bring jobs back !
crooked hillary clinton has destroyed jobs and manufacturing in pennsylvania against steelworkers and miners husband signed nafta
leaked e mails of dnc show plans to destroy bernie sanders mock his heritage and much more on line from wikileakes really vicious rigged
pocahontas wanted v p slot so badly but was n't chosen because she has done nothing in the senate also crooked hillary hates her !
tim kaine is and always has been owned by the banks bernie supporters are outraged was their last choice bernie fought for nothing !
the bernie sanders supporters are furious with the choice of tim kaine who represents the opposite of what bernie stands for philly fight \?
i highly recommend the just out book the field of fight by general michael flynn how to defeat radical islam
is it the same kaine that took hundreds of thousands of dollars in gifts while governor of virginia and did n't get indicted while bob m did \?
another attack this time in germany many killed god bless the people of munich

in november i think the people of ohio will remember that the republicans picked cleveland instead of going to another state jobs !

i would have millions of votes more than hillary except for the fact that i had opponents and she just had a socialist named bernie !
crooked hillary clinton is spending a fortune on ads against me i am the one person she does n't want to run against will be such fun !

wisconsin 's economy is doing poorly and like everywhere else in u s jobs are leaving i will make our economy strong again bring in jobs
nobody will protect our nation like donald j trump our military will be greatly strengthened and our borders will be strong illegals out !
lyin' ted cruz is now trying to convince prople that his problems with the national enq were caused by me i had nothing to do with story !
the press is going out of their way to convince people that i do not like or respect women when they know that it is just the opposite !
the media is so after me on women wow this is a tough business nobody has more respect for women than donald trump !
top suspect in paris massacre salah abdeslam who also knew of the brussels attack is no longer talking weak leaders ridiculous laws !

hillary clinton has been working on solving the terrorism problem for years time for a change i will solve and fast !
it is amazing how often i am right only to be criticized by the media illegal immigration take the oil build the wall muslims nato !
these politicians like cruz and graham who have watched isis and many other problems develop for years do nothing to make things better !
we pay a disproportionate share of the cost of n a t o why \? it is time to renegotiate and the time is now !
n a t o is obsolete and must be changed to additionally focus on terrorism as well as some of the things it is currently focused on !
while i believe i will clinch before cleveland and get more than delegates it is unfair in that there have been so many in the race !
i think having jeb 's endorsement hurts lyin' ted jeb spent more than and got nothing i spent a fraction of that and am first !
i will be the best by far in fighting terror i m the only one that was right from the beginning amp now lyin ted amp others are copying me
just watched hillary deliver a prepackaged speech on terror she s been in office fighting terror for years and look where we are !
low energy jeb bush just endorsed a man he truly hates lyin ted cruz honestly i can t blame jeb in that i drove him into oblivion !
lyin ted cruz steals foreign policy from me and lines from michael douglas just another dishonest politician
lyin' ted cruz denied that he had anything to do with the g q model photo post of melania that 's why we call him lyin' ted !
hopefully the republican party can come together and have a big win in november paving the way for many great supreme court justices !

i have proven to be far more correct about terrorism than anybody and it s not even close hopefully az and ut will be voting for me today !
president obama looks and sounds so ridiculous making his speech in cuba especially in the shadows of brussels he is being treated badly !
do you all remember how beautiful and safe a place brussels was not anymore it is from a different world ! u s must be vigilant and smart !
wow president obama just landed in cuba a big deal and raul castro was n't even there to greet him he greeted pope and others no respect

hillary clinton has been involved in corruption for most of her professional life !
looking like my victories on tuesday will be just as good as if i won ohio two more days and ohio was mine !
the reason lyin' ted cruz has lost so much of the evangelical vote is that they are very smart and just do n't tolerate liars a big problem !

everybody is laughing at jeb bush spent million and is at bottom of pack a pathetic figure !
jeb bush is desperate strongly in favor of commoncore and very weak on illegal immigration

dr ben carson blasted ted cruz for deceit and dirty tricks and lies
cruz just lied again i am and have been totally against obamacare repeal and replace !
the state of iowa should disqualify ted cruz from the most recent election on the basis that he cheated a total fraud !
based on the fraud committed by senator ted cruz during the iowa caucus either a new election should take place or cruz results nullified
and finally cruz strongly told thousands of caucusgoers \( voters \) that trump was strongly in favor of obamacare and choice a total lie !
the voter violation certificate gave poor marks to the unsuspecting voter \( grade of f \) and told them to clear it up by voting for cruz fraud
many people voted for cruz over carson because of this cruz fraud also cruz sent out a voter violation certificate to thousands of voters
ted cruz did n't win iowa he stole it that is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated bad !
anybody who watched all of ted cruz 's far too long rambling overly flamboyant speech last nite would say that was his howard dean moment !
i do n't believe i have been given any credit by the voters for self funding my campaign the only one i will keep doing but not worth it !
i will be talking about my wonderful experience in iowa and the simultaneous unfair treatment by the media later in new hampshire big crowd
the media has not covered my long shot great finish in iowa fairly brought in record voters and got second highest vote total in history !
because i was told i could not do well in iowa i spent very little there a fraction of cruz amp rubio came in a strong second great honor
my experience in iowa was a great one i started out with all of the experts saying i could n't do well there and ended up in nd place nice
it all begins today we will finally take our country back and make america great again !
so nice to get an endorsement from the founder and owner of pizza ranch in iowa ! a great guy and great places ! caucusfortrump

wow just saw an ad cruz is lying on so many levels there is nobody more against obamacare than me will repeal amp replace he lies !

if ted cruz is so opposed to gay marriage why did he accept money from people who espouse gay marriage \?
ted cruz purposely and illegally did not list on his personal disclosure form personally guaranteed loans from banks they own him !
based on the fact that ted cruz was born in canada and is therefore a natural born canadian did he borrow unreported loans from c banks \?

remember that i am self funding my campaign hillary jeb and the rest are spending special interest and lobbyist money controlled
hillary said such nasty things about me read directly off her teleprompter but there was no emotion no truth just ca n't read speeches !
hillary clinton made a speech today using the biggest teleprompter i have ever seen in fact it was n't even see through glass it was black
saudi arabia was vehemently against the iran nuclear deal then today they embraced it what happened \? what did we give them to endorse \?

the dallas event in two weeks at the american airlines center is filling up fast get your tickets fast before it is too late !
congratulations to tom brady on yet another great victory tom is my friend and a total winner !
the deal with iran will go down as one of the most incompetent ever made the u s lost on virtually every point we just do n't win anymore !
when i intelligently turned down the club for growth crazy request for they got nasty what a waste of money that would have been
the president of the pathetic club for growth came to my office in n y c and asked for a ridiculous contribution i said no way !
i m turning down millions of dollars of campaign contributions feel totally stupid doing so but hope it is appreciated by the voters
many super pacs funded by groups that want total control over their candidate are being formed to attack trump remember when u see them
congrats everyone we topped million today on twitter and heading up fast !
while millions are being spent against me in attack ads they are paid for by the bosses and owners of candidates i am self funding

this story is no longer about john mccain it s about our horribly treated vets illegals are treated better than our wonderful veterans
it was only after i informed nbc that i would n't do the apprentice that they became upset w me they couldn t care less about inclusion
we will soon be at a point with our incompetent politicians where we will be treating illegal immigrants better than our veterans
i will be making some very big campaign stops next week big crowds and tremendous energy ! make america great again
the republican party must get tougher and smarter and fast or it will go down to a very big defeat just like the last two times !
the veterans administration is in shambles and our veterans are suffering greatly john mccain has done nothing to help them but talk
john mccain called thousands of people crazies when they came to seek help on illegal immigration last week in phoenix he owes apology !
one of the reasons i am no fan of john mccain is that our vets are being treated so badly by him and the politicians i will fix va quickly
i have a proven track record supporting our veterans veterans deserve universal access to care va scandal proves politicians are inept
that has served our country is put on a waiting list and gets no care
it 's a national embarrassment that an illegal immigrant can walk across the border and receive free health care and one of our veterans
i will make this right for our great vets !
all he does is go on television is talk talk talk but incapable of doing anything
john mccain has failed miserably to fix the situation and to make it possible for veterans to successfully manage their lives
the veterans of our country have been treated like third class citizens for many years
captured or not all our soldiers are heroes !
in addition to doing a lousy job in taking care of our vets john mccain let us down by losing to barack obama in his run for president !
just left family leadership summit in iowa got a standing ovation from many wonderful people i will be back soon

i ca n't believe that president obama is n't able or willing to make just one phone call to the family of kate steinle come on pres make call !
let pete rose into the baseball hall of fame it 's time he has paid a big and very long price !
i absolutely support kate s law in honor of the beautiful kate steinle who was gunned down in sf by an illegal immigrant
mexico s totally corrupt gov t looks horrible with el chapo s escape totally corrupt u s paid them billion
the joke around town is that i freed el chapo from the mexican prison because the timing was so good w my statements on border security
isn t it interesting that now that i m in the polls the networks show polls that are a month old !
when will people and the media start to apologize to me for my statement mexico is sending which turned out to be true \? el chapo
likewise billions of dollars gets brought into mexico through the border we get the killers drugs amp crime they get the money !
el chapo and the mexican drug cartels use the border unimpeded like it was a vacuum cleaner sucking drugs and death right into the u s
the u s will invite el chapo the mexican drug lord who just escaped prison to become a u s citizen because our leaders ca n't say no !
but that 's what i 've been saying very unfair treatment by the media !
now that the mexican drug lord escaped from prison everyone is saying that most of the cocaine etc coming into the u s comes over border !
trump however would kick his ass !
can you envision jeb bush or hillary clinton negotiating with 'el chapo' the mexican drug lord who escaped from prison \?
mexico 's biggest drug lord escapes from jail unbelievable corruption and usa is paying the price i told you so !
phoenix convention center officials did not want to have thousands of people standing outside in the heat so they let them in a great day !
convention center officials in phoenix do n't want to admit that they broke the fire code by allowing people in code room
i will not be able to attend the miss usa pageant tomorrow night because i am campaigning in phoenix wishing all well !
getting ready to go to las vegas \( freedom fest \) great crowd then on to amazing phoenix that will be a total happening ! love america

jeb bush just announced he raised over m everyone of those people who contributed are getting something to the detriment of america !
iran continues to delay the nuclear deal while doing many bad things behind our backs time to walk and double the sanctions stop payments !
obama and republicans are hollowing out our military now want to cut troop levels lowest level in over years
you mean george bush sends our soldiers into combat they are severely wounded and then he wants to make a boring speech to them \?
jeb 's brother george insisted on a fee and for a private jet to speak at a charity for severely wounded vets not nice !
i will be in california this weekend making a speech for clint eastwood then to arizona and vegas big crowds discussing illegals amp more !
people rarely say that many conservatives didn t vote for mitt romney if i can get them to vote for me we win in a landslide
we have got to take our country back it 's time !
i said simply that the mexican leaders and negotiators are smarter than ours and that the mexican gov't is pushing their hard core to u s
jeb bush will never secure our border or negotiate great trade deals for american workers jeb does n't see amp ca n't solve the problems
i appreciate the gop candidates who remain strong on border security they know i am right a nation without borders cannot survive
rick perry failed at the border now he is critical of me he needs a new pair of glasses to see the crimes committed by illegal immigrants
miss universe paulina vega criticized me for telling the truth about illegal immigration but then said she would keep the crown hypocrite
why would republican candidates want the support of mitt romney he lost an election against obama that should never have been lost !
what about the undocumented immigrant with a record who killed the beautiful young women \( in front of her father \) in san fran get smart !
happy th of july to everyone ! make america great again !
my heartfelt condolences to the family of kathryn steinle very very sad !
a nation that cannot control its borders is not a nation president ronald reagan
wow huffington post just stated that i am number in the polls of republican candidates thank you but the work has just begun !
mexican leaders and negotiators are much tougher and smarter than those of the u s mexico is killing us on jobs and trade wake up !
obama once again just missed a self imposed deadline with iran our leadership is weak amp ineffective double the sanctions !
i love the mexican people but mexico is not our friend they 're killing us at the border and they 're killing us on jobs and trade fight !
we must have strong borders and stop illegal immigration without that we do not have a country also mexico is killing u s on trade win !
remember univision apologized !
univision apologized to me but i will not accept their apology i will be suing them for a lot of money miss u s a contestants are hurt !
see story in fusion and huff post about rape at the border beyond terrible ! is n't fusion owned by univision \?
will be in chicago tomorrow for a record setting \( by far \) luncheon
i 'll be in iowa tonight making a speech to a record setting crowd the word is getting out make america great again !
the leader and negotiators representing mexico are far smarter and more cunning than the leader and negotiators representing the u s !
only very stupid people think that the united states is making good trade deals with mexico mexico is killing us at the border and at trade !
when you are in a war or even a battle losing is not an option !
when somebody challenges you unfairly fight back be brutal be tough do n't take it it is always important to win !
if i win the presidency my judicial appointments will do the right thing unlike bush 's appointee john roberts on obamacare
once again the bush appointed supreme court justice john roberts has let us down jeb pushed him hard ! remember !
i love mexico but not the unfair trade deals that the us so stupidly makes with them really bad for us jobs only good for mexico
mexican gov does n't want me talking about terrible border situation amp horrible trade deals forcing univision to get me to stop no way !
governor rick scott of florida did really poorly on television this morning i hope he is o k
i hear that dopey political pundit lawrence o'donnell one of the dumber people on television is about to lose his show no ratings \? too bad

uncomfortable looking nbc reporter willie geist calls me to ask for favors and then mockingly smiles when he is told of my high poll numbers
my daughter ivanka will be representing me today at the opening of our campaign office in manchester nh makeamericagreatagain !

stop saying i went bankrupt i never went bankrupt but like many great business people have used the laws to corporate advantage smart !

that said the rich arab countries should get involved with the syrian mess not us we should start rebuilding our own country amp military
why do we keep broadcasting when we are going to attack syria why ca n't we just be quiet and if we attack at all catch them by surprise \?
i give the president 's speech a on the scale of to ! not bad but room for improvement !
